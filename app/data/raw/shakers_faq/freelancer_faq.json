    "question": "VAT: how VAT works, how it is paid to the tax authorities, how it is deducted?",
    "answer": "1. Charging VAT: When a self-employed person issues an invoice for the provision of services, they must add the corresponding VAT to the sale price. This VAT charged is collected from the customer and broken down on the invoice, showing the amount before tax, the VAT rate applied (usually 21%, although it can be 10% or 4% depending on the product or service), and the total amount including VAT.\n\n\n\n\n2. VAT settlement: Self-employed workers must submit a VAT return (form 303) to the Tax Agency on a quarterly basis. In this return, the input VAT (paid on purchases) is subtracted from the output VAT (charged on sales).\n\nIf the VAT charged is greater than the VAT paid, the difference must be paid to the Tax Agency.\n\nIf the input VAT is greater than the output VAT, a refund of the difference can be requested or it can be offset in future returns.\n\n3. Forms 303 and 390:\n\n\nForm 303: This is submitted quarterly and is the form used to settle VAT.\n\nForm 390: This is an annual summary return of all transactions subject to VAT carried out during the year. It is filed in January of the year following the fiscal year.\n\n4. VAT rates: There are different VAT rates depending on the product or service:\n\n\nGeneral rate (21%): Most goods and services.\n\nReduced rate (10%): Food products, transport services, hotels and restaurants, etc.\n\nSuper-reduced rate (4%): Essential products such as bread, milk, books, medicines, etc."

    "answer": "Shakers is a startup whose mission is to become the home of (freelance) talent, a place where we can meet face to face and satisfy any work-related need, from networking to receiving legal support.\n\nBut to get there, we have to take many steps, and that's why we've decided to start with the first and most important one: offering you good projects.\n\nWe don't let just any client in; we filter projects just as we filter you. We evaluate the project (making sure it's not a gig job, that the hourly rate is decent, etc.) and we evaluate the client itself (making sure they know how to deal with freelancers, etc.).\n\nWe do all this through a matching algorithm (like Tinder)🪄 that takes into account not only professional aspects, but also motivational and personal ones. As we like to say, we don't want to match Java with Java, but Javier with Javier. We know that if you are truly motivated by your work, nothing can stop you.\n\nThat's why we are NOT a freelancer search engine like the others, we are not a kind of e-commerce site where you are a face with a price, we are a project search engine where you (are at the center of everything), you choose to apply for projects, although as we are a startup and we are improving our team, they may come looking for you."

Good feedback gives the client the opportunity to respond, express their concerns, and address your questions.\n\nAnticipates problems: Following a feedback schedule provides an opportunity to discuss negative behaviors or issues that affect the project and try to resolve them before they lead to disputes or project failure.\n\nCheck tasks/objectives: Feedback gives us the opportunity to discuss urgent tasks/milestones and overall objectives. Talking openly with the client or team helps to identify what is realistic or achievable in the current phase of the project."

    "question": "How can I improve my communication with the client?",
    "answer": "Good communication with the client can be your greatest ally and will give you an advantage.\n\nHere are some tips! 💡\n\n👂Listen and analyze: From the moment you read the client's briefing for the first time to the final phase of the project, it is important to analyze everything the client is looking for and study how to offer it to them. Thanks to this analysis, you will also know what you need to successfully complete this project and set it apart from the start.\n\n🤝 Interest and empathy: Show interest in the project and your client's interests, recommend improvements whenever you think it's necessary, and let them know that you understand their needs. (TIP: If you put yourself in their shoes, you'll get a better perspective on the project and be able to offer them more and better).\n\n⁉️ Ask questions (but don't flood their email): Asking the right questions will prevent future misunderstandings and make a good impression, ensuring you deliver what they want and fulfill the purpose of the project.\n\n🗣 Be mindful of jargon: Keep in mind that the client is hiring you because they need an expert, which means they are not one. Avoid using acronyms and use concrete terms whenever possible, addressing them in a way that is easy to understand."

Shakers holds that payment until you complete and deliver the milestone.\n\n2. Deliver\n\n📦 Once you have completed the milestone work, click \"Deliver.\" This means:\n\nYou are communicating to the client that the work for that milestone is ready\n\nThe client will review and validate the delivery\n\nOnce validated, the field to upload the invoice for that milestone will be enabled\n\n3. Completed\n\n✅ When the milestone is validated and completed, it changes to \"Completed\" status.\n\nThis allows you to see on your dashboard:\n\nWhich milestones are in progress\n\nWhich ones you have already delivered\n\nAnd how many have been completed\n\n🧭 It's an easy way to track the progress of the project, both for you and for the client.\n\nYou can manage milestones during a project from the project's \"Dashboard\" tab.\n\nIf the client does not approve your work, don't worry; you are not alone.

    "question": "What is the match percentage and how does it work?",
    "answer": "It's your degree of affinity with a project. As a freelancer, it helps you quickly identify the projects you're most motivated to work on, and as a client, it helps you filter candidates interested in your project.\n\nShakers was born with a mission: to help millions of people wake up inspired and satisfied with the work they do. For this to happen, we need to work on things that motivate us and make us want to get out of bed in the morning. Today's workers are no longer satisfied with just a project and a guarantee of payment at the end. Today's workers want challenges; they want their work to align with their lifestyle and values. If you're a basketball fan, wouldn't you rather work for the NBA than Coca-Cola?\n\nThat's why we decided to create an algorithm that goes beyond the typical variables taken into account in other talent or project marketplaces (professional skills, experience, etc.) and includes variables such as motivation and personality."
  },
  {
    "audience": "freelancer",
    "source": "shakers_faq",
    "question": "How does the algorithm work?",
    "answer": "To calculate the match, we use a hybrid approach that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. Collaborative filtering is based on prior information provided by users, both freelancers and clients (variables that we have categorized as \"base\" variables and \"accuracy\" variables).\n\nOn the other hand, content-based filtering uses specific information about each candidate and job (such as skills and experience) to recommend similar jobs or candidates. These techniques are implemented in an deep learning architecture that improves the accuracy of our recommendation systems and improves our accuracy with each project and each candidate."

  {
    "audience": "freelancer",
    "source": "shakers_faq",
    "question": "What are the variables used by the algorithm?",
    "answer": "Base variables\n\nThese are required in order to calculate a match percentage. They are used to calculate a base match percentage and ensure that the minimum technical requirements for applying to a project are always met.\n\nFreelancer's knowledge: naturally, we take into account a freelancer's technical knowledge (specialties, super specialties, skills, and tools they know how to use).\n\nFreelancer's experience: we use information about the skills developed in past projects. \n\nProject requirements: the set of knowledge and skills that a client demands for their project.\n\nThis way, a user who has the skills \"WordPress\" or \"Web Design\" validated in their profile will have a high \"base\" match percentage with projects that require those skills. \n\nSimilarly, a user who has no knowledge of a technology such as \"React\" will never be able to have a high enough match percentage to apply for a \"React\" project.\n\nAccuracy variables\n\nThe second set of variables allows us to adjust the match percentage based on criteria beyond strictly professional ones, rewarding users who have a higher level of motivation and cultural fit with a project.\n\nAt Shakers, we have a mantra: a motivated worker will always deliver better results than one who is only looking for a paycheck at the end of the month. That's why we should always try to find candidates who stand out not only for their skills, but also for their desire to participate in a project.\n\nPersonality: based on the Big Five personality model, we have designed two personality tests for the workplace that allow us to predict the level of personal affinity between a freelancer, a client, and the entire team that will be participating in a project. Because, don't we all like to have a good vibe at work? Right?\n\nMotivation: after conducting a study of more than 80 freelancers and company managers, we found that the variables that most influence motivation are: the type of professional challenge, the company's values, and the industry or sector of that company. Therefore, we have designed a test to identify a freelancer's interests and give a higher match percentage to projects that fit the talent's motivations.\n\nIf you want the match percentage you see in the application to be as accurate as possible, you will need to  so that all these accuracy variables can be taken into account."

    "answer": "It's very simple! Shakers provides you with tools to encourage continuous feedback, which facilitates good communication between clients and talent and allows Shakers account managers to closely monitor the project.\n\nThere are project application chats and video calls. You can chat with the client through the chats, so everything will be written down and the Shakers team will be able to keep track of your communication.\n\nYou can also use your own means to communicate with the client (your Slack, your email, etc.), but in that case, we provide you with the feedback tool so that you can keep a record of your work and we can help you in the event of a possible dispute. If you do your job well and keep a record of it, you are guaranteed to get paid. You can access the feedback section as follows:\n\n\nOpen your active project.\n\nScroll down to the bottom and click on the \"Go to project\" button.\n\nAt the top, you will see the \"👉🏼 Feedback\" panel where you can include your weekly feedback. In this weekly feedback, it is important to include the objectives achieved during the week, what is still pending, if you have any dependencies, the next steps, etc.\n\nIMPORTANT: if your client asks you for things outside the scope of what was agreed in the proposal, ALWAYS contact your Account Manager or support so that we are aware of this and can help you. If we are not aware of this, in the event of a dispute (a client does not want to validate a milestone), it will be your word against theirs.\n\n\n⚠️ If you have not sent feedback by Monday morning, the client will receive a notification indicating that you have not sent this week's feedback.\n\n\n\nAnd that's it, ready to go!"

    "question": "Why do you limit access to Shakers?",
    "answer": "At Shakers, we limit access to ensure quality, balance, and real opportunities for freelancers. We prioritize those who are already active members of the community. We are committed to long-term relationships, not one-off collaborations."

    "question": "Can I know more about Shakers?",
    "answer": "At Shakers, we don't want to be just another platform. We want to be your home as a freelancer, a place where you can find real, well-paid opportunities that allow you to grow.\n\nThat's why we limit access to the platform. It's not to exclude anyone, but to take care of the experience of each person who joins. Our goal is to achieve a real balance between the amount of talent and the availability of projects.\n\nEven so, with limited access, you can view some projects and apply for them. We want you to start exploring how Shakers works and give you the opportunity to showcase your talent from the very beginning.\n\n\n\n🎯 Quality > Quantity\n\nWe prefer to offer fewer projects, but of higher quality. It's part of our philosophy: we don't seek to have thousands of irrelevant projects or sign up talent en masse. We are committed to the best, which is why we filter both the projects that come in and the freelance profiles that access the platform. We want the best.\n\nYes, that means there may be fewer projects available at certain times. But it also means that the projects that are available are good ones, designed to really add value to your career.\n\n⚖️ Balance\n\nWe're committed to maintaining balance within the platform. We want to ensure that there are enough projects for all active freelancers. If there are no opportunities that suit you at a given moment, we prefer that you wait. That way, when you log in, you'll have a better chance of finding a project that really interests you.\n\n🚀 Your first project: the key to Share of Wallet\n\nYour first project is much more than a one-off collaboration. It is the gateway to the Shakers ecosystem. From that moment on, we become part of your client portfolio, and our goal is to remain relevant in your professional career. We call this Share of Wallet.\n\nWe want you to come back, grow with us, and find a stable space to work as a freelancer at Shakers. No one-off projects or sporadic relationships. We are committed to long-term relationships. \n\nSo much so that our North Star Metric, the metric that guides everything we do, is the number of people who work more than 100 hours a month with us. That's the sign that we're on the right track.\n\nNow do you understand why we limit access and prioritize the talent that is already inside? We close the community because we will always put those who are already working or about to close their next project first. We want you to find continuity, not just opportunities.\n\n🔝 Priority in projects\n\nWhen you join Shakers, your profile will have priority over others with limited access. More visibility and better options from day one."

    "answer": "Spoiler: no.\n\nThis is a very common question, and the short answer is that you don't need to be registered as a freelancer to sign up for Shakers.\n\nWhat is true is that the projects you will find on the platform are designed for freelance profiles, but that does not mean you have to be one from the outset."

You'll find projects designed for your lifestyle: collaborations with startups, large companies, and teams that value autonomy and specialization.\n\nAgencies and studios\n\nIf you are part of an agency or studio, you can also be part of Shakers. The important thing is that the profile that registers and collaborates on projects is the professional who will carry out the work, not a commercial profile.\nThis allows us to maintain our focus on technical and creative talent."

Once you unlock your access, you will see the active projects and be able to assess whether these types of opportunities fit what you are looking for.\n\nThe idea is that when you decide to take the plunge and launch yourself as a freelancer, you're already in, you know how it works, and you have a clear understanding of how the ecosystem operates."

    "question": "Do I have to live in Spain?",
    "answer": "Another frequently asked question. And the answer, again: no, but it can help in some cases.\n\nMost projects are 100% remote, and our community is global. We collaborate with talent from all over the world.\n\nHowever, for some projects it may be useful, or even necessary, for you to live in Spain. For example, if the client wants to hold occasional face-to-face meetings or there are legal requirements such as access to sensitive systems."
