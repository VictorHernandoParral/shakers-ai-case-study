And when the client is satisfied, they give you more freedom. That's our hack.\n\nIt is not mandatory to follow this methodology, but we highly recommend it. In addition, the platform is designed to help you follow it effortlessly.\n\nWhat does our methodology consist of?\n\nIt's very simple: it's based on good communication, transparent monitoring, and continuous feedback. These are the pillars:\n\nüí¨ Clear communication from the outset\n\nUse the candidate chats and video calls available on the platform to talk to your client.\n\nEverything said through these channels is recorded, allowing the Shakers team to help you if mediation is needed.\n\nPrefer to use Slack or email? No problem. But if you do, we recommend using our feedback tool to keep track of progress.\n\nüìù Weekly feedback\n\nA fundamental part of the methodology is weekly feedback.

    "answer": "‚ò¢Ô∏è You are failing Shakers and your talent\n\nWe don't need to explain what it means in administrative terms when an invoice is overdue, as you are in breach of the contract.\n\nThat's why we want to highlight what non-payment means for Shakers:\n\nThe talent will not be able to get paid for their work until we receive payment from you: We use a secure payment system to try to avoid situations where freelancers are not paid on time for their work, but if we have not received your payment by the invoice due date, you will not be able to validate that the talent has fulfilled their part of the agreement and you will therefore be delaying their payment.\n\n\nWe know that there are exceptional situations, which is why your project success manager and our administration team are always available to help.\n\n(The solution is never going to disappear.)\n\n\nIn addition, the talent will be informed that there is an outstanding invoice on your part, and they can decide whether to continue with the work even without guaranteed payment; or, on the contrary, they can decide to halt their work until we have guaranteed payment. If this option is chosen, the project will be halted until payment of the invoice is received.\n\n\nWe demand the best from our talent and therefore want to give them the best. We ask that you do not publish a project until you can afford it financially; this is a serious matter.\n\nIf the non-payment cannot be resolved, please note that you will be removed from the platform."

    "answer": "The Shakers payment system allows you and the talent to work securely and always be on the same page, ensuring that you never pay for work that you haven't approved.\n\nAll proposals you receive on Shakers will be divided into one or more milestones or deliverables.\n\nThese milestones or deliverables will determine the total number of invoices you will need to pay Shakers, as well as the number of invoices Shakers will pay the talent once you have validated their work."

    "source": "shakers_faq",
    "question": "Why work by milestones?",
    "answer": "There are three reasons why we work by milestones or deliverables at Shakers.\n\nIt allows talent to be paid progressively, rather than in large amounts, which benefits them both in terms of financial stability and in managing their tax payments (VAT).\n\nIt allows you, as a client, to make controlled payments instead of having to pay large sums at the beginning or end of a project.\n\nIt allows us to control the quality of the work delivered, as well as make modifications to the initial specifications."

  {
    "audience": "company",

    "question": "How does the payment system work?",
    "answer": "We use a system similar to Smart Contracts to guarantee:\n\nThat talent works with the assurance that they will be paid after delivering their work\n\nThat companies work with the peace of mind that they will not pay for work that they have not validated.\n\nThis chart explains the secure payment system, which is repeated with each milestone of a project.\n\nYou accept a talent's proposal, and both parties commit to complying with the defined terms and conditions.\n\nYou deposit the amount associated with the first milestone, which Shakers will hold until you validate the delivery of the work.\n\nWe notify the talent so they can start working with peace of mind.\n\nThe talent works on the milestone until the work is delivered and requests your validation.\n\nYou validate the delivery of the work.\n\nAfter your validation, we send the payment to the talent."

    "question": "What are Shakers payment methods?",
    "answer": "üîê Shakers Payments\n\nWe only work through this option, as Shakers acts as an intermediary in all cases. Therefore, Shakers will be your only service provider (so you won't have to register a new supplier every time you hire a freelancer), and Shakers will be responsible for making payments to the talents.\n\nIn this model, each invoice will be linked to a milestone that the freelancer will include in their proposal.\n\nWith the aim, on the one hand, of protecting your money and, on the other, of guaranteeing your solvency to the freelancer, an \"escrow\" methodology is used, which works as follows:\n\nYou decide when the freelancer should start working on each milestone. To do this, you must activate the milestone by making a payment to Shakers for the total value of that milestone.\n\nShakers will hold the money until the work is completed.\n\nWhen the freelancer completes the work, you will have to validate it.\n\nOnly when you have validated the work will we send the money we held to the freelancer, thus ensuring that you only pay for work that has been completed and validated.\n\nIn addition, in our working model, Shakers provides you with a Project Success, an expert in your project area who will support and monitor the project, helping you to manage any possible disputes."

    "answer": "Here are the reasons why a project may be put on hold\n\nWe don't want to reach that point for anything in the world! That's why at Shakers we try to facilitate and simplify the entire work process as much as possible, but there are situations in which we can no longer intervene. \n\nHere are the reasons why a project may be halted:\n\nLoss of contact: when one of the two parties (client - talent/s) disappears and we are unable to contact them after repeated attempts. If the party involved is unable to respond and the project success manager is also unable to contact them, the project is halted, and different actions will be taken depending on which party is absent:\n\nIf the client does not respond: if we have tried to contact them repeatedly and have not received a response, we ask the talent to put their work on hold and inform them of the situation.\nAt that point, the talent decides whether to continue with the project and wait for the client to respond, or to close their work up to that point and look for another project to participate in.\nIf the talent wishes to close their work, they will be paid for the milestone they were involved in at that time and the project will be closed. The client will be informed of these actions by email and will be rejected from the platform.\n\nIf the talent does not respond: if we have tried to contact them repeatedly and have not received a response from the talent, we will get to work to cover for them, trying to ensure that this has as little impact as possible on the established timings.\nThe talent and the client will be informed that we are going to call on one of our Top Shakers to take over the tasks that were being carried out by the talent and that we do not know if they are being fulfilled due to the lack of response. That milestone and subsequent ones taken care of by the Top Shaker will be paid to that talent, and not to the talent who is not responding to us.\nAt the same time, we will proceed to reject the talent from the platform for having breached one of our most important policies\n\nNon-payment: if the invoice associated with a milestone is not paid by the client on the established date, the talent involved will be informed of this fact and may decide whether to continue developing the milestone or, on the contrary, to halt the project until we can guarantee payment. It is important for our talents to know that we guarantee payment with our secure payment system , so if the first part of the system fails, the project may be halted.\n\n\n\nEven so, we want you to know that we are willing to help you with anything you need, and that before reaching this point, you can talk to your Project Success about any problems you have with the project so that we can find a solution for both parties. We want to make your life easier! üçÄ"

    "answer": "We ensure that perfect connection between talent and project thanks to the match calculated by our algorithm\n\nOur algorithm not only takes into account the needs of the project and the professional skills of our freelancers, but also other personal variables (interests, personality, etc.) that are key to ensuring that teams work comfortably and are motivated."
  },
  {
    "audience": "company",
    "source": "shakers_faq",
    "question": "How does the algorithm work?",
    "answer": "To calculate the match, we use a hybrid approach that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. Collaborative filtering is based on previous information provided by users, both freelancers and clients (variables that we have categorized as \"base\" variables and \"precision\" variables).\n\nOn the other hand, content-based filtering uses specific information about each candidate and job (such as skills and experience) to recommend similar jobs or candidates. These techniques are implemented in a deep learning architecture that improves the accuracy of our recommendation systems and improves our accuracy with each project and each candidate."
  },
  {
    "audience": "company",
    "source": "shakers_faq",
    "question": "What are the variables used by the algorithm?",
    "answer": "Base variables\n\nThese are required in order to calculate a match percentage. They are used to calculate a base match percentage and ensure that the minimum technical requirements for applying to a project are always met.\n\nFreelancer's knowledge: naturally, we take into account a freelancer's technical knowledge (specialties, super specialties, skills, and tools they know how to use).\n\nFreelancer's experience: we use information about the skills developed in past projects. \n\nProject requirements: the set of knowledge and skills that a client demands for their project.\n\nAccuracy variables\n\nThe second set of variables allows us to adjust the match percentage based on criteria beyond strictly professional ones, rewarding users who have a higher level of motivation and cultural fit with a project.\n\nAt Shakers, we have a mantra: a motivated worker will always deliver better results than one who is only looking for a paycheck at the end of the month. That's why we should always try to find candidates who stand out not only for their skills, but also for their desire to participate in a project.\n\nPersonality: based on the Big Five personality model, we have designed two personality tests for the workplace that allow us to predict the level of personal affinity between a freelancer, a client, and the entire team that will be participating in a project. Because, don't we all like to have a good vibe at work? Right?\n\nMotivation: after conducting a study of more than 80 freelancers and company managers, we found that the variables that most influence motivation are: the type of professional challenge, the company's values, and the industry or sector of that company. Therefore, we have designed a test to identify the interests of a freelancer and give a higher match percentage to projects that fit with the talent's motivations."

    "audience": "company",
    "source": "shakers_faq",
    "question": "What is the match percentage used for?",
    "answer": "Firstly, the match percentage serves as a reference for evaluating which projects may be of interest to you as a freelancer,\n\nand which candidates are best suited to your project as a client.\n\nWhen talent searches for projects on Shakers, they are sorted from highest to lowest match level, so they can apply to those that really suit them."

Depending on the level of detail in your briefing, the process will be more or less complex.\n\nIf you've browsed through any projects posted on the Shakers platform, you'll see that we try to provide as much detail as possible so that the Shakers in our community can really assess whether it's worth investing time in the selection process for that project. \n\nWhen a project is not very clear, misunderstandings arise, leading to confusion, which ends up causing problems. Therefore, it is very important to do things right from the start. It is the best formula for ensuring success.\n\nTherefore, depending on the level of detail in the briefing you sent in the  process, two things can happen:\n\nIf your briefing is sufficiently detailed, we will contact you by email to confirm a few quick questions and upload your project to the platform. \n\nIf your briefing is unclear and we need to go into more detail, a Shakers digital consultant will contact you to help you define your needs in terms of the necessary profiles, roadmap, and budget.\n\nOnce uploaded, all Shakers will be able to see it published, see how well they match the project thanks to our , and apply.\n\nWe manage the publication from Shakers to validate that the project has the information and format established by Shakers."

    "question": "How do I publish a project?",
    "answer": "From \"My organization,\" go to the \"Projects\" section. From the Home page or the side menu on the left, you will find a \"New project\" button.\n\nTo hire freelance talent on Shakers, you first need to publish a project. Once you have published the project, you will receive candidates in less than 24 hours and you will be able to select the candidates that are the best match for your project.\n\nFrom the Home page, in the side menu, or from the \"My Organization\" page, you will see the \"New Project\" button.\n\n\nClicking on the button will open a form where you must specify the briefing for your project in three steps:\n\n1. Select a category:\n\nChoose the type of project you want to carry out from the categories Development, Design, or Marketing. For each project, you will see the estimated time it will take to find a candidate and start working.\n\n\nIt is important to choose the right category, as our artificial intelligence will help you create a briefing tailored to the type of project you have selected. If you cannot find your project among those we offer, .\n\n2. Write a briefing:\n\nThis is the most crucial part of creating your project, as the better written the briefing is, the greater your ability to attract the highest quality talent.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful! Shakers freelancers are senior professionals looking for quality projects that motivate them. That's why we filter all the projects we launch to the community. A vague or poorly written description runs the risk of not being published.\n\nBut don't worry, if you follow the steps below, you'll be able to write a briefingüîù and capture the attention of the best digital talent.\n\nStep 1: Title\n\nFollow our AI's suggestions or choose a title that quickly describes your needs.\n\nStep 2: About your company\n\nAdd a brief description of your company's activity. Keep in mind that the best professionals are not only looking for projects to work on, but projects that motivate them, so the better you \"sell\" your company, the more you will attract the attention of freelancers.\n\nWe will use the information you include here to match your project with the talent that is most motivated to work in companies like yours.\n\nStep 3: Project objectives\n\nIn this section, you need to define as clearly as possible what you want to achieve with your project:\n\nObjectives or deliverables: what you hope to achieve with your project. For example: development of a website.\n\nTasks to be performed: tasks you expect to be included during the process. For example: writing website content or creating brand identity\n\nFreelancer support: tasks that you or your team will take care of so that the freelancer doesn't have to. For example: purchasing and configuring the domain.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Answer the talent's FAQs\n\nDepending on the type of project you have selected, you will be shown a series of common questions that freelancers often have about this type of project. Get ahead of the game and avoid answering the same question to every candidate interested in your project.\n\nYou can add customized FAQs to provide more information.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Scope\n\nAdd the date you would like to start and the estimated duration of the project.\n\n\n\nFreelancers are usually more interested in long-term, ongoing projects, so a short-term project may be more difficult to find top talent for.\n\nStep 6: Budget\n\nIndicate an estimate of the budget you have available for the project. This budget is simply a guideline, as the final budget will depend on the proposals you receive from freelancers.\n\n\n\n3. Confirm the skills\n\nBased on the content of your briefing, our artificial intelligence will detect the skills you need to successfully carry out your project.\n\nConfirm the skills and add new ones if you find that any skills you need for your project are missing.\n\n\n\n4. Set up your Dream Team\n\nBased on the skills you need and all the information you have provided in the briefing, the artificial intelligence will recommend the number of positions your team needs to carry out the project. \n\n\n\nYou can review and edit them if you think it's necessary (this helps our AI improve for future projects, so thank you in advanceüòÖ ).\n\nOnce these steps are complete, two things can happen:\n\nIf your briefing is sufficiently detailed, we will contact you by email to confirm a few quick questions and upload your project to the platform. \n\nIf your briefing is unclear and we need to go into more detail, a Shakers digital consultant will contact you to help you define your needs in terms of the necessary profiles, roadmap, and budget.\n\nAnd then you'll have your project on the Shakers app!\n\n\n\nYour first steps: we'll show you how to use the app\n\nHave you just registered and don't know where to start? Here are some interesting things! üëÄ\n\nIf you've just joined Shakers and aren't sure what to do, you can start by going to your organization's page and checking if you can add more information about your company:\n\n\n\nFor a good match with talents, it's not only the project information that's important, but also everything you have about your organization. Make sure you polish that up as much as possible, and we'll make sure you work with the ideal talent for you!\n\n\n\nOnce that's done, the next step is to get the ball rolling!\n\nFrom the Home page, in the side menu, or from the \"My Organization\" page, you will see the \"New Project\" button.
