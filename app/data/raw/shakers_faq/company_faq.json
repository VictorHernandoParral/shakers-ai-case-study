    "answer": "‚ò¢Ô∏è You are failing Shakers and your talent We don't need to explain what it means in administrative terms when an invoice is overdue, as you are in breach of the contract. That's why we want to highlight what non-payment means for Shakers: The talent will not be able to get paid for their work until we receive payment from you: We use a secure payment system to try to avoid situations where freelancers are not paid on time for their work, but if we have not received your payment by the invoice due date, you will not be able to validate that the talent has fulfilled their part of the agreement and you will therefore be delaying their payment. We know that there are exceptional situations, which is why your project success manager and our administration team are always available to help. (The solution is never to disappear.) In addition, the talent will be informed that there is an outstanding invoice on your part, and they can decide whether to continue with the work even without guaranteed payment; or, on the contrary, they can decide to halt their work until we have guaranteed payment. If this option is chosen, the project will be halted until payment of the invoice is received. We demand the best from our talent and therefore want to give them the best. We ask that you do not publish a project until you can afford it financially; this is a serious matter. If the non-payment cannot be resolved, please note that you will be removed from the platform."

    "question": "How does the secure payment system work?",
    "answer": "The Shakers payment system allows you and the talent to work securely and always be on the same page, ensuring that you never pay for work that you haven't approved. All proposals you receive on Shakers will be divided into one or more milestones or deliverables. These milestones or deliverables will determine the total number of invoices you will need to pay Shakers, as well as the number of invoices Shakers will pay the talent once you have validated their work."

    "question": "Why work by milestones?",
    "answer": "There are three reasons why we work by milestones or deliverables at Shakers. It allows talent to be paid progressively, rather than in large amounts, which benefits them both in terms of financial stability and in managing their tax payments (VAT). It allows you, as a client, to make controlled payments instead of having to pay large sums at the beginning or end of a project. It allows us to control the quality of the work delivered, as well as make modifications to the initial specifications."

  {
    "audience": "company",

    "question": "How does the payment system work?",
    "answer": "We use a system similar to Smart Contracts to guarantee: That talent works with the assurance that they will be paid after delivering their work That companies work with the peace of mind that they will not pay for work that they have not validated. This chart explains the secure payment system, which is repeated with each milestone of a project. You accept a talent's proposal, and both parties commit to complying with the defined terms and conditions. You deposit the amount associated with the first milestone, which Shakers will hold until you validate the delivery of the work. We notify the talent so they can start working with peace of mind. The talent works on the milestone until the work is delivered and requests your validation. You validate the delivery of the work. After your validation, we send the payment to the talent."

    "question": "How can I activate and validate milestones?",
    "answer": "You can manage milestones during a project from the project's \"Dashboard\" tab. Payment method at Shakers üîê Shakers Payments We only work through this option, as Shakers acts as an intermediary in all cases. Therefore, Shakers will be your only service provider (so you won't have to register a new supplier every time you hire a freelancer), and Shakers will be responsible for making payments to the talents. In this model, each invoice will be linked to a milestone that the freelancer will include in their proposal. With the aim, on the one hand, of protecting your money and, on the other, of guaranteeing your solvency to the freelancer, an \"escrow\" methodology is used, which works as follows: You decide when the freelancer should start working on each milestone. To do this, you must activate the milestone by making a payment to Shakers for the total value of that milestone. Shakers will hold the money until the work is completed. When the freelancer completes the work, you will have to validate it. Only when you have validated the work will we send the money we held to the freelancer, thus ensuring that you only pay for work that has been completed and validated. In addition, in our working model, Shakers provides you with a Project Success, an expert in your project area who will support and monitor the project, helping you to manage any possible disputes. ü§î Check out the article  where we explain in depth how milestones are managed and how our payment system works. Reasons why a project may be put on hold We'll tell you ‚¨áÔ∏è We don't want to reach that point for anything in the world! That's why at Shakers we try to facilitate and simplify the entire work process as much as possible, but there are situations in which we can no longer intervene. Here are the reasons why a project may be halted: Loss of contact: when one of the two parties (client - talent/s) disappears and we are unable to contact them after repeated attempts. If the party involved is unable to respond and the project success manager is also unable to contact them, the project is halted, and different actions will be taken depending on which party is absent: If the client does not respond: if we have tried to contact them repeatedly and have not received a response, we ask the talent to put their work on hold and inform them of the situation.\nAt that point, the talent decides whether to continue with the project and wait for the client to respond, or to close their work up to that point and look for another project to participate in.\nIf the talent wishes to close their work, they will be paid for the milestone they were involved in at that time and the project will be closed. The client will be informed of these actions by email and will be rejected from the platform. If the talent does not respond: if we have tried to contact them repeatedly and have not received a response from the talent, we will get to work to cover for them, trying to ensure that this has as little impact as possible on the established timings.\nThe talent and the client will be informed that we are going to call on one of our Top Shakers to take over the tasks that were being carried out by the talent and that we do not know if they are being fulfilled due to the lack of response. That milestone and subsequent ones taken care of by the Top Shaker will be paid to that talent, and not to the talent who is not responding to us.\nAt the same time, we will proceed to reject the talent from the platform for having breached one of our most important policies Non-payment: if the invoice associated with a milestone is not paid by the client on the established date, the talent involved will be informed of this fact and may decide whether to continue developing the milestone or, on the contrary, to halt the project until we can guarantee payment. It is important for our talents to know that we guarantee payment with our secure payment system , so if the first part of the system fails, the project may be halted. Even so, we want you to know that we are willing to help you with anything you need, and that before reaching this point, you can talk to your Project Success about any problems you have with the project so that we can find a solution for both parties. We want to make your life easier! üçÄ"

    "answer": "A project published on Shakers can have these 11 statuses: üìù Draft: This is the first status when you create a project. If you leave the project before completing all the information and publishing it, it will remain as a draft. You can return to edit and complete it whenever you want. ‚è≥ Under review: When you complete all the project information and click \"Publish,\" it will change to \"Under review\" status.

When the project is \"Active,\" it means that you are already working on it. ‚ùå Rejected: Projects published in search of candidates that are not activated, for whatever reason, will be given this status.

In this case, the Shakers team will mark the project as \"Postponed.\" Candidates will be notified of this situation and contacted automatically when you decide to resume the project. üóÇ Archived: This status will be associated with projects that have never been published on Shakers, either because they have been in \"Draft\" for more than a week or because they do not meet Shakers' publication standards. üèÅ Completed: Project finished!

If the answer is yes, it means that your profile meets all the requirements for the position you are seeking, but if the answer is no, review which skills, abilities, or other items may be missing from your profile in order to achieve a high match. What projects have they worked on? Review their portfolio to see what projects they have worked on, how they have done so, and whether you like the results. Open the chat! Talk to the freelancer to see if you like how they communicate, if you understand each other, and if you are aligned with the project. Plus, you can make a video call through the same chat whenever you want! üìπ Answer any questions the freelancer may have so that they can prepare a proposal that is 100% tailored to your needs. Analyze the proposal Review the proposal they have prepared for you to see if they have captured the project development and your needs, and if they have included everything necessary to start working. You've got it! If everything fits and you think there's no better option, just click \"Accept proposal\" and let the magic happen. ü™Ñ"

    "question": "How do we achieve the perfect match between project and talent?",
    "answer": "We ensure that perfect connection between talent and project thanks to the match calculated by our algorithm Our algorithm not only takes into account the needs of the project and the professional skills of our freelancers, but also other personal variables (interests, personality, etc.) that are key to ensuring that teams work comfortably and are motivated."
  },
  {
    "audience": "company",
    "source": "shakers_faq",
    "question": "How does the algorithm work?",
    "answer": "To calculate the match, we use a hybrid approach that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. Collaborative filtering is based on previous information provided by users, both freelancers and clients (variables that we have categorized as \"base\" variables and \"precision\" variables). On the other hand, content-based filtering uses specific information about each candidate and job (such as skills and experience) to recommend similar jobs or candidates. These techniques are implemented in a deep learning architecture that improves the accuracy of our recommendation systems and improves our accuracy with each project and each candidate. Variables used by the algorithm Base variables These are required in order to calculate a match percentage. They are used to calculate a base match percentage and ensure that the minimum technical requirements for applying to a project are always met. Freelancer's knowledge: naturally, we take into account a freelancer's technical knowledge (specialties, super specialties, skills, and tools they know how to use). Freelancer's experience: we use information about the skills developed in past projects. Project requirements: the set of knowledge and skills that a client demands for their project. Accuracy variables The second set of variables allows us to adjust the match percentage based on criteria beyond strictly professional ones, rewarding users who have a higher level of motivation and cultural fit with a project. At Shakers, we have a mantra: a motivated worker will always deliver better results than one who is only looking for a paycheck at the end of the month. That's why we should always try to find candidates who stand out not only for their skills, but also for their desire to participate in a project."

Because, don't we all like to have a good vibe at work? Right?",
    "answer": "Motivation: after conducting a study of more than 80 freelancers and company managers, we found that the variables that most influence motivation are: the type of professional challenge, the company's values, and the industry or sector of that company.

    "question": "What do I have to do once I have submitted the project?",
    "answer": "For now, just wait. Depending on the level of detail in your briefing, the process will be more or less complex. If you've browsed through any projects posted on the Shakers platform, you'll see that we try to provide as much detail as possible so that the Shakers in our community can really assess whether it's worth investing time in the selection process for that project. When a project is not very clear, misunderstandings arise, leading to confusion, which ends up causing problems. Therefore, it is very important to do things right from the start. It is the best formula for ensuring success. Therefore, depending on the level of detail in the briefing you sent in the  process, two things can happen: If your briefing is sufficiently detailed, we will contact you by email to confirm a few quick questions and upload your project to the platform. If your briefing is unclear and we need to go into more detail, a Shakers digital consultant will contact you to help you define your needs in terms of the necessary profiles, roadmap, and budget. Once uploaded, all Shakers will be able to see it published, see how well they match the project thanks to our , and apply. We manage the publication from Shakers to validate that the project has the information and format established by Shakers."

    "question": "How do I publish a project?",
    "answer": "From \"My organization,\" go to the \"Projects\" section. From the Home page or the side menu on the left, you will find a \"New project\" button. To hire freelance talent on Shakers, you first need to publish a project. Once you have published the project, you will receive candidates in less than 24 hours and you will be able to select the candidates that are the best match for your project. From the Home page, in the side menu, or from the \"My Organization\" page, you will see the \"New Project\" button. Clicking on the button will open a form where you must specify the briefing for your project in three steps: 1. Select a category: Choose the type of project you want to carry out from the categories Development, Design, or Marketing. For each project, you will see the estimated time it will take to find a candidate and start working. It is important to choose the right category, as our artificial intelligence will help you create a briefing tailored to the type of project you have selected. If you cannot find your project among those we offer, . 2. Write a briefing: This is the most crucial part of creating your project, as the better written the briefing is, the greater your ability to attract the highest quality talent. ‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful! Shakers freelancers are senior professionals looking for quality projects that motivate them. That's why we filter all the projects we launch to the community. A vague or poorly written description runs the risk of not being published. But don't worry, if you follow the steps below, you'll be able to write a briefingüîù and capture the attention of the best digital talent. Step 1: Title Follow our AI's suggestions or choose a title that quickly describes your needs. Step 2: About your company Add a brief description of your company's activity. Keep in mind that the best professionals are not only looking for projects to work on, but projects that motivate them, so the better you \"sell\" your company, the more you will attract the attention of freelancers. We will use the information you include here to match your project with the talent that is most motivated to work in companies like yours. Step 3: Project objectives In this section, you need to define as clearly as possible what you want to achieve with your project: Objectives or deliverables: what you hope to achieve with your project. For example: development of a website. Tasks to be performed: tasks you expect to be included during the process. For example: writing website content or creating brand identity Freelancer support: tasks that you or your team will take care of so that the freelancer doesn't have to. For example: purchasing and configuring the domain. Step 4: Answer the talent's FAQs Depending on the type of project you have selected, you will be shown a series of common questions that freelancers often have about this type of project. Get ahead of the game and avoid answering the same question to every candidate interested in your project. You can add customized FAQs to provide more information. Step 5: Scope Add the date you would like to start and the estimated duration of the project. Freelancers are usually more interested in long-term, ongoing projects, so a short-term project may be more difficult to find top talent for. Step 6: Budget Indicate an estimate of the budget you have available for the project. This budget is simply a guideline, as the final budget will depend on the proposals you receive from freelancers. 3. Confirm the skills Based on the content of your briefing, our artificial intelligence will detect the skills you need to successfully carry out your project. Confirm the skills and add new ones if you find that any skills you need for your project are missing. 4. Set up your Dream Team Based on the skills you need and all the information you have provided in the briefing, the artificial intelligence will recommend the number of positions your team needs to carry out the project. You can review and edit them if you think it's necessary (this helps our AI improve for future projects, so thank you in advanceüòÖ ). Once these steps are complete, two things can happen: If your briefing is sufficiently detailed, we will contact you by email to confirm a few quick questions and upload your project to the platform. If your briefing is unclear and we need to go into more detail, a Shakers digital consultant will contact you to help you define your needs in terms of the necessary profiles, roadmap, and budget.
