**Answer:**

üîê Shakers Payments

We only work through this option, as Shakers acts as an intermediary in all cases. Therefore, Shakers will be your only service provider (so you won't have to register a new supplier every time you hire a freelancer), and Shakers will be responsible for making payments to the talents.

In this model, each invoice will be linked to a milestone that the freelancer will include in their proposal.

With the aim, on the one hand, of protecting your money and, on the other, of guaranteeing your solvency to the freelancer, an "escrow" methodology is used, which works as follows:

You decide when the freelancer should start working on each milestone. To do this, you must activate the milestone by making a payment to Shakers for the total value of that milestone.

Shakers will hold the money until the work is completed.

When the freelancer completes the work, you will have to validate it.

Only when you have validated the work will we send the money we held to the freelancer, thus ensuring that you only pay for work that has been completed and validated.

In addition, in our working model, Shakers provides you with a Project Success, an expert in your project area who will support and monitor the project, helping you to manage any possible disputes.
