**Answer:**

Quick and easy ⬇️

Work with your team within Shakers by following these simple steps:

In the side menu, click on: "My organization," where you will find a summary of your activity on the platform, allowing you to see the projects you have carried out, the members of Shakers, the talents you have worked with, the billing, and information related to your organization.

Once inside, go to the "Members" tab, where you can invite more people from your team and edit each of their permissions.

Now click on the invite button and add the email addresses of as many members of your team as you deem necessary, press enter, and send them the invitation.

As soon as the person you wanted to add accepts the invitation, they will be inside Shakers. ⚡️
