# What statuses can a project have?

**Q:** What statuses can a project have?

**A:** A project published on Shakers can have these 11 statuses: 📝 Draft: This is the first status when you create a project. If you leave the project before completing all the information and publishing it, it will remain as a draft. You can return to edit and complete it whenever you want. ⏳ Under review: When you complete all the project information and click "Publish," it will change to "Under review" status. This means that our team of experts is reviewing the briefing to validate that all the information is correct. If any information is missing, they will contact you before publishing it. ✅ Published: Once our team of experts has validated that the project has the necessary information to be published on the platform, they will make it visible to the community. At that point, the project status will be "Published" and all our talents will be able to apply for the associated positions. 💬 Evaluating candidates: As soon as one or more talents have applied to the project, the status will change to "Evaluating candidates." This means that you can now talk to them via chat and video calls so that they can present you with a proposal. 📥 Reviewing proposals: When one or more candidates upload a proposal to the app in relation to your project, it will change to "Reviewing proposals" status, which means you will have proposals on the table to evaluate and decide on. ✍️ Pre-active: When you accept one or more proposals, the project status will be "Pre-active." In this case, our Project Success team will contact you within two business hours to let you know the next steps to activate the project and start working. 🚀 Active: You will have followed all the necessary steps to start working! When the project is "Active," it means that you are already working on it. ❌ Rejected: Projects published in search of candidates that are not activated, for whatever reason, will be given this status. Only the Shakers team can mark this status. When a project is marked as "Rejected," all candidates who have applied are rejected and all open conversations are closed. 🔜 Postponed: You have published a project, met candidates, but for whatever reason you have decided to postpone the start date. In this case, the Shakers team will mark the project as "Postponed." Candidates will be notified of this situation and contacted automatically when you decide to resume the project. 🗂 Archived: This status will be associated with projects that have never been published on Shakers, either because they have been in "Draft" for more than a week or because they do not meet Shakers' publication standards. 🏁 Completed: Project finished! Once the work is done, you have two options: Extend the agreement and continue working while the project remains "active." Submit a review and mark the project as completed. Job done and project finished!
