**Answer:**

As you know, we are a closed community proud to have the best talent. Just as we demand effort from our talent, we are committed to being equally demanding with our clients. Therefore, we remove access to companies that:

Have not shown interest in publishing any projects in the first month after registration.

Have not posted any projects or worked on an active project in the last year.

Have posted projects with briefings and/or budgets that are not appropriate for the professional level of the talent.

After publishing a project, they have stopped accessing and responding to interested talent.

They do not comply with our secure payment policy.


If none of these apply to you, you have received a rejection notice on the platform and you believe it is a mistake, or if you have a project to publish that meets Shakers' quality standards, contact us at and we will take care of it!
