# How do I communicate with my team/talent?

**Q:** How do I communicate with my team/talent?

**A:** All the ways to keep up to date with your Shakers team There are several ways you can communicate with your team. Depending on the type of communication and who you want to address, you will use one channel or another. After hundreds of projects and thousands of hours of observing the work between freelancers and clients, at Shakers we have developed a methodology that: Day-to-day with the team ðŸ’¬ Chat You can talk to the entire project team at any time. You can do this in two ways: 1. Group chat with the entire project team: You can access it from the "Chat" tab on the project dashboard. 2. Individual chats: You can create conversations with one or more people, including: Any member of a project you are working on. Shakers talent team (if you have any questions or need help). Shakers Project Success Manager (who will work to ensure the success of the project). From the chat itself, you can request a meeting with your talent or talents and make a video call there. Finally, you can view all your conversations from ðŸ¤– Task activity In the project dashboard tab, talents can see their tasks and move them according to their status. These tasks may or may not be associated with milestones, and you can add comments to your work team for all of them. All team members responsible for or involved in that task will receive a notification. ðŸ™ƒ Of course, you don't have to give up traditional channels. If you're not comfortable with them, you can always send an email or pick up the phone! Feedback At the end of the week, the talent will receive a notification to send feedback to you or the project manager in your organization. This feedback will be notified to you within the app and you will be able to see it in the "feedback" tab of the project. At Shakers, we recommend that both parties work with the feedback, as it helps to ensure the success of the project. The talent can comment on any doubts or concerns they may have, and you can resolve them before they become a problem.
