**Answer:**

Let's take it step by step...

Yes, it's free to create an account on Shakers! 

But... The way we operate sets us apart from other platforms. It's not the client who has the catalog of freelancers, but rather the freelancers who apply to the projects that motivate them, the ones they know they are best at (that doesn't mean we're going to choose your freelancer for you).

You publish the project, specifying your needs and the profile you require (if you're not sure, our artificial intelligenceðŸ§  will recommend the best positions and skills to make your project a success).

Once the project is published, freelancers will apply to your project, sending you their proposals and quotes to carry it out. At that point, you will be able to view their profiles and meet with each of them to find the perfect match for your needs.

You decide which freelancer to hire, and it is important to know that only those who meet the requirements you have set, who have a sufficient match percentage with your project, and who have the necessary skills to carry it out will apply.
