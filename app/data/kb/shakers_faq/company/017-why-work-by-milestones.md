**Answer:**

There are three reasons why we work by milestones or deliverables at Shakers.

It allows talent to be paid progressively, rather than in large amounts, which benefits them both in terms of financial stability and in managing their tax payments (VAT).

It allows you, as a client, to make controlled payments instead of having to pay large sums at the beginning or end of a project.

It allows us to control the quality of the work delivered, as well as make modifications to the initial specifications.
