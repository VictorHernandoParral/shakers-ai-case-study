**Answer:**

Each time a project milestone is activated, a new invoice will be created.

You can access them from the "Billing" tab in 

There you will see a summary of all your organization's invoices for all the projects you have done on Shakers.

From there, you can view and download all invoices and their status. There are four statuses: 

ðŸ“¥ Waiting for invoice: We have not yet uploaded the invoice from Shakers

ðŸ’¸ Pending payment: We have uploaded the invoice but have not received payment. To the right of all these invoices, we can see their due date, and in some cases, pending payment may also mean that the invoice is past due and has not been paid.

ðŸ‘Œ Paid: We have received payment. Everything is OK

From each project's dashboard

If you only want to see the invoices for a specific project, you can also access them with a simple click from each project's dashboard.
