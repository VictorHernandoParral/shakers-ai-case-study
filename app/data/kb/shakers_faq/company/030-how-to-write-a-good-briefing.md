# How to write a good briefing?

**Q:** How to write a good briefing?

**A:** We give you step-by-step tips to make your briefing the best ever! 🏆 Type of project Be sure to select the right category for your project so that our Artificial Intelligence can select your perfect team without a hitch! Psst! If you hover your mouse over the "?" you'll see a little more detail about what each category consists of. 🤓 LET'S CONTINUE 🚀 Project description Choose a title that summarizes what you're going to do or adapt one of our suggested titles. They say we're the Tinder of freeworking, so sell yourself well so that when talents read it, they'll want to meet with your company! 🥰 Let's get down to business!🗣 This is one of the most important parts of the briefing, so put a lot of thought into it to make sure everything is crystal clear! What objectives/deliverables are expected to be achieved?➡️ List everything you want to have once the project is completed, so that talents can take all these milestones into account when creating their proposal. What specific tasks are expected to be performed?  ➡️ Detail all the tasks you want to be performed, add here if you want recurring meetings, specific tasks, and all the necessary clarifications. How will the team be supported?➡️ It is extremely important for our freelancers to know what support the company will provide, so tell them here how you will support them so that they don't feel alone in the face of danger. 🤺 Add attachments➡️ If you have any files that may be useful for finalizing the proposal, this is the place to add them! For each type of project, our AI will show you the questions that our freelancers usually have in order to submit a detailed proposal. Answer as many as you can so that you don't waste time later discussing these issues in chat. We love efficiency! 😍 Time!⏱ This is a precious commodity, so make sure you get this part right. When do you want to start? Keep in mind when you need to start the project as a deadline, so that the talents who apply know whether or not they will be available on that initial date. And the duration? Also consider when you need the project delivered, so that talents can estimate the time commitment required. We've got it! 🤩 Essential!💸 If you set your budget, the talent will know what the limits are and can tailor their proposal to a budget that suits your needs. NEXT 🚀 Our AI already has a team proposal for your project. It may be one or more positions, depending on what you have specified you need. Here is an example: If it fits what you're looking for, click "Yes" and the position will remain in the project. In addition, if you click on the pencil icon next to the position, you can add more details about Specialties, Skills, Tools, and you can even add qualification questions for applicants to answer, saving you another step in the profile evaluation process! If the position doesn't suit you, you can click "No," and you'll have the option to edit whatever you want about that position or even delete it. Do you need more profiles on the team?⬇️ Click here! Got everything? WOOOOOW, we're so happy for you! You're just one click away from starting to work with talent and efficiency. ⚡️🚀 CLICK AND LET THE ADVENTURE BEGIN!
