**Answer:**

☢️ You are failing Shakers and your talent

We don't need to explain what it means in administrative terms when an invoice is overdue, as you are in breach of the contract.

That's why we want to highlight what non-payment means for Shakers:

The talent will not be able to get paid for their work until we receive payment from you: We use a secure payment system to try to avoid situations where freelancers are not paid on time for their work, but if we have not received your payment by the invoice due date, you will not be able to validate that the talent has fulfilled their part of the agreement and you will therefore be delaying their payment.


We know that there are exceptional situations, which is why your project success manager and our administration team are always available to help.

(The solution is never going to disappear.)


In addition, the talent will be informed that there is an outstanding invoice on your part, and they can decide whether to continue with the work even without guaranteed payment; or, on the contrary, they can decide to halt their work until we have guaranteed payment. If this option is chosen, the project will be halted until payment of the invoice is received.


We demand the best from our talent and therefore want to give them the best. We ask that you do not publish a project until you can afford it financially; this is a serious matter.

If the non-payment cannot be resolved, please note that you will be removed from the platform.
