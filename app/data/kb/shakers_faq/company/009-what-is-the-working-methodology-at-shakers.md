**Answer:**

After hundreds of projects and thousands of hours analyzing how freelancers and clients work, at Shakers we have developed an agile methodology designed to:

‚úÖ Enhance the freedom and flexibility of freelance talent.
‚úÖ Increase customer satisfaction and trust.

Both objectives feed into each other: when you are motivated to work, the results improve. And when the client is satisfied, they give you more freedom. That's our hack.

It is not mandatory to follow this methodology, but we highly recommend it. In addition, the platform is designed to help you follow it effortlessly.

What does our methodology consist of?

It's very simple: it's based on good communication, transparent monitoring, and continuous feedback. These are the pillars:

üí¨ Clear communication from the outset

Use the candidate chats and video calls available on the platform to talk to your client.

Everything said through these channels is recorded, allowing the Shakers team to help you if mediation is needed.

Prefer to use Slack or email? No problem. But if you do, we recommend using our feedback tool to keep track of progress.

üìù Weekly feedback

A fundamental part of the methodology is weekly feedback. It serves to:

Inform the client of the project's progress.

Leave a written record of what has been done (and what has not).

Ensure that, if you do your job well, you will always get paid.
