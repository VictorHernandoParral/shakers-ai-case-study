# What is the working methodology at Shakers?

**Q:** What is the working methodology at Shakers?

**A:** After hundreds of projects and thousands of hours analyzing how freelancers and clients work, at Shakers we have developed an agile methodology designed to: ✅ Enhance the freedom and flexibility of freelance talent.
✅ Increase customer satisfaction and trust. Both objectives feed into each other: when you are motivated to work, the results improve. And when the client is satisfied, they give you more freedom. That's our hack. It is not mandatory to follow this methodology, but we highly recommend it. In addition, the platform is designed to help you follow it effortlessly.
