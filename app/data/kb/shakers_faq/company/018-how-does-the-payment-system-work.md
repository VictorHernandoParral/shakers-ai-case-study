**Answer:**

We use a system similar to Smart Contracts to guarantee:

That talent works with the assurance that they will be paid after delivering their work

That companies work with the peace of mind that they will not pay for work that they have not validated.

This chart explains the secure payment system, which is repeated with each milestone of a project.

You accept a talent's proposal, and both parties commit to complying with the defined terms and conditions.

You deposit the amount associated with the first milestone, which Shakers will hold until you validate the delivery of the work.

We notify the talent so they can start working with peace of mind.

The talent works on the milestone until the work is delivered and requests your validation.

You validate the delivery of the work.

After your validation, we send the payment to the talent.
