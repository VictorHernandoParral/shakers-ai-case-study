**Answer:**

There are several elements to consider in order to choose the best candidate for a project, in order:

Review their profile

When a candidate applies to your project, review everything related to their profile, such as:

Do you have a high match percentage for the position? If the answer is yes, it means that your profile meets all the requirements for the position you are seeking, but if the answer is no, review which skills, abilities, or other items may be missing from your profile in order to achieve a high match.

What projects have they worked on? Review their portfolio to see what projects they have worked on, how they have done so, and whether you like the results.
