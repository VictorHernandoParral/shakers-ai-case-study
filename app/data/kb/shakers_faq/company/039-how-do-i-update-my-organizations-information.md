# How do I update my organization's information?

**Q:** How do I update my organization's information?

**A:** From the side menu, you can access "My Organization," where you'll find all the information related to your company. In the "Information" tab, you can edit your company's basic information, as well as billing details that will streamline administrative procedures when you start working on a project, and "match" information that will help our algorithm find the ideal candidates for your projects. Company name: the name that freelancers working on your projects will see. Website: your website address. Company name, tax ID number, address, and phone number: this information allows us to speed up the generation of contracts and agreements to be signed before starting work on a project. It also speeds up contact when we have a phone number to call. ⚠️ It is important to keep this information up to date so that Shakers can contact you whenever necessary.
