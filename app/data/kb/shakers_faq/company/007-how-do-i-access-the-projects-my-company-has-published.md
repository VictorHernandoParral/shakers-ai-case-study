# How do I access the projects my company has published?

**Q:** How do I access the projects my company has published?

**A:** If you have administrator access to your organization (check the permissions in the article How do I add users to my organization? ), you can see all the projects your company has published from the "Projects" tab in "My organization." From here, you can see all the projects, the person in charge of managing them at your company, their status, the team involved, and you can access the project dashboard where you will find all the information related to the project. Check out the article  to learn about the six statuses that a project in your company can have.
