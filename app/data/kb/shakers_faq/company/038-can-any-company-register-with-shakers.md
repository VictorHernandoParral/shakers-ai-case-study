**Answer:**

Feel free! ðŸ¤²

At Shakers, we want to bring the best talent to everyone, which is why our doors are open to any client who wants to register on the platform, try out how we work, and publish a project to find the best talent to carry it out.

However, we are a closed community, and although we initially open our doors to clients, we have a commitment to our talents.

Just as we guarantee quality talent to our clients, we guarantee our talents a platform that offers them the same, so if you do not meet certain requirements, you may be removed from the platform as a client.
