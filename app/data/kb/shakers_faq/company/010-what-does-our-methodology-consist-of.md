# What does our methodology consist of?

**Q:** What does our methodology consist of?

**A:** It's very simple: it's based on good communication, transparent monitoring, and continuous feedback. These are the pillars: üí¨ Clear communication from the outset Use the candidate chats and video calls available on the platform to talk to your client. Everything said through these channels is recorded, allowing the Shakers team to help you if mediation is needed. Prefer to use Slack or email? No problem. But if you do, we recommend using our feedback tool to keep track of progress. üìù Weekly feedback A fundamental part of the methodology is weekly feedback. It serves to: Inform the client of the project's progress. Leave a written record of what has been done (and what has not). Ensure that, if you do your job well, you will always get paid.
