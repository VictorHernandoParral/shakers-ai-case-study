# Personality: based on the Big Five personality model, we have designed two personality tests for the workplace that allow us to predict the level of personal affinity between a freelancer, a client, and the entire team that will be participating in a project. Because, don't we all like to have a good vibe at work? Right?

**Q:** Personality: based on the Big Five personality model, we have designed two personality tests for the workplace that allow us to predict the level of personal affinity between a freelancer, a client, and the entire team that will be participating in a project. Because, don't we all like to have a good vibe at work? Right?

**A:** Motivation: after conducting a study of more than 80 freelancers and company managers, we found that the variables that most influence motivation are: the type of professional challenge, the company's values, and the industry or sector of that company. Therefore, we have designed a test to identify the interests of a freelancer and give a higher match percentage to projects that fit with the talent's motivations.
