**Answer:**

To calculate the match, we use a hybrid approach that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. Collaborative filtering is based on previous information provided by users, both freelancers and clients (variables that we have categorized as "base" variables and "precision" variables).

On the other hand, content-based filtering uses specific information about each candidate and job (such as skills and experience) to recommend similar jobs or candidates. These techniques are implemented in a deep learning architecture that improves the accuracy of our recommendation systems and improves our accuracy with each project and each candidate.
