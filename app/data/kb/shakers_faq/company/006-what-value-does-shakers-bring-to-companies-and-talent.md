# What value does Shakers bring to companies and talent?

**Q:** What value does Shakers bring to companies and talent?

**A:** In this article, you will understand the value that Shakers brings to both companies and talent, and how we allocate the amount we retain from each project. The proposals you receive through the app include both the amount the freelancer will receive and the amount Shakers will retain for the transaction.

This retained amount varies depending on the type of project and the freelancer's category (we reach different agreements based on knowledge, experience, and other factors) and is used to cover Shakers' value proposition to clients and freelancers: A member of our Project Success team, who will follow up throughout the project, whose remuneration depends on the level of satisfaction of the talent and client during and at the end of the project. Project management tools at your disposal (task manager, chat, video calls, weekly feedback, etc.). Project delivery guarantees in the event that a freelancer is unable to complete the project. Serving our talent community: We provide tools for talent so they can devote 100% of their time to working on what they are passionate about (proposal creator, invoice management, etc.). We accompany talent in their day-to-day work to help them improve as professionals (training, courses, etc.) and keep up to date with the latest technology, thus ensuring that you always have the best talent for your projects. Maintenance of the platform and refinement of the matching algorithm.
