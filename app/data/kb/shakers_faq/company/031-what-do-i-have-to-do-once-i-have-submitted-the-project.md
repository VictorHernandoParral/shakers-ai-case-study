**Answer:**

For now, just wait. Depending on the level of detail in your briefing, the process will be more or less complex.

If you've browsed through any projects posted on the Shakers platform, you'll see that we try to provide as much detail as possible so that the Shakers in our community can really assess whether it's worth investing time in the selection process for that project. 

When a project is not very clear, misunderstandings arise, leading to confusion, which ends up causing problems. Therefore, it is very important to do things right from the start. It is the best formula for ensuring success.

Therefore, depending on the level of detail in the briefing you sent in the  process, two things can happen:

If your briefing is sufficiently detailed, we will contact you by email to confirm a few quick questions and upload your project to the platform. 

If your briefing is unclear and we need to go into more detail, a Shakers digital consultant will contact you to help you define your needs in terms of the necessary profiles, roadmap, and budget.

Once uploaded, all Shakers will be able to see it published, see how well they match the project thanks to our , and apply.

We manage the publication from Shakers to validate that the project has the information and format established by Shakers.
