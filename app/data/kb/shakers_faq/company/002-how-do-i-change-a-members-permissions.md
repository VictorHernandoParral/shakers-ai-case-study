# How do I change a member's permissions?

**Q:** How do I change a member's permissions?

**A:** You can change permissions at any time by clicking on the three dots on the right. There are three types of permissions: Owner💪 : This is the creator of the organization and has all permissions. Admin✍️ : Can edit organization information and access billing, has all management permissions for an organization, except the ability to delete it or edit the owner. Member☝️ : Can work on projects, has only basic permissions, and cannot access organization information. Only information about projects in which they are included as part of the team.
