**Answer:**

At the end of the week, the talent will receive a notification to send feedback to you or the project manager in your organization.

This feedback will be notified to you within the app and you will be able to see it in the "feedback" tab of the project. 

At Shakers, we recommend that both parties work with the feedback, as it helps to ensure the success of the project. The talent can comment on any doubts or concerns they may have, and you can resolve them before they become a problem.
