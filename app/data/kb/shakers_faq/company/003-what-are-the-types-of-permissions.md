**Answer:**

There are three types of permissions:

Owner💪 : This is the creator of the organization and has all permissions.

Admin✍️ : Can edit organization information and access billing, has all management permissions for an organization, except the ability to delete it or edit the owner.

Member☝️ : Can work on projects, has only basic permissions, and cannot access organization information. Only information about projects in which they are included as part of the team.
