**Answer:**

Firstly, the match percentage serves as a reference for evaluating which projects may be of interest to you as a freelancer,

and which candidates are best suited to your project as a client.

When talent searches for projects on Shakers, they are sorted from highest to lowest match level, so they can apply to those that really suit them.
