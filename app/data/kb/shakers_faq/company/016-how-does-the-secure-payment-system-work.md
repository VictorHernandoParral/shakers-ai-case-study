# How does the secure payment system work?

**Q:** How does the secure payment system work?

**A:** The Shakers payment system allows you and the talent to work securely and always be on the same page, ensuring that you never pay for work that you haven't approved. All proposals you receive on Shakers will be divided into one or more milestones or deliverables. These milestones or deliverables will determine the total number of invoices you will need to pay Shakers, as well as the number of invoices Shakers will pay the talent once you have validated their work.
