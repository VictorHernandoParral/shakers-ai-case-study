**Answer:**

Shakers does the hard work for you and provides a maximum of three candidates per position. You are ultimately responsible for choosing the selected Shaker.

Once the project is published, Shakers admitted to the platform will begin to apply. 

Shakers' talent unit, in collaboration with Shakers' digital consultant, will conduct an initial screening of candidates to save you from wasting time evaluating profiles that are not qualified for your project.

Depending on:

The urgency of the position

Your preferences (if you don't want us to bore you and prefer to get straight to the point, we will only give you one optionðŸ¤™ )

The complexity of the position (finding a graphic designer is not the same as finding a 3D animation specialist with experience in the cosmetics industryðŸ˜… )

We preselect a maximum of 3 candidates per position.

We provide you with the details and the opportunity to meet with each of the candidates, accompanied by a member of the Shakers talent team.

Once you have decided which candidate you feel most comfortable with, we will add that person to your team until the entire team is formed.
