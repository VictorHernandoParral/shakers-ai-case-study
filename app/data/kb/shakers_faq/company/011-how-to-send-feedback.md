# How to send feedback?

**Q:** How to send feedback?

**A:** Open your active project. Scroll down and click on "go to project." At the top, you will see the Feedback panel👉🏼 . Complete the report with: Goals achieved Pending tasks Dependencies (if any) Next steps 💡 Tip: Good feedback protects you. If there is a dispute with the client, your feedback will be your best ally. ⚠️ Important: requests outside the scope If a client asks you for something outside the scope agreed upon in the proposal, always contact your Account Manager or support. Do not let these cases go unnoticed. If we are not aware of them, in the event of a dispute it will be your word against the customer's. 🔔 Automatic reminder If you haven't sent feedback by Monday morning, the customer will receive an automatic notification. This is a way to encourage follow-up without having to be on top of them. Take advantage of this tool to maintain momentum and trust! And that's it, now you know how we work at Shakers.
It's simple, agile, and designed so that you can work comfortably and with support.
