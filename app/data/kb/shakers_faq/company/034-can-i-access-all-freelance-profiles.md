# Can I access all freelance profiles?

**Q:** Can I access all freelance profiles?

**A:** Oops! We don't have a catalog. ðŸ«£ The value of Shakers is our reverse approach; we operate differently from other freelance platforms on the market. Therefore, you cannot directly access our talent database to contact them. But that doesn't mean you can't see anything! When you post your project, you'll be able to see the profiles of the talents with the highest match for the position(s) you've posted, and you can invite up to three profiles for each position. In addition, all our talents will see that project in the app, and anyone who is interested can apply. That's right! You'll be able to view the profiles of all applicants and talk to them to decide which one best fits your project, and then get to work! ðŸ¥³
