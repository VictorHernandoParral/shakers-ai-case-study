# How can I start working with a freelancer?

**Q:** How can I start working with a freelancer?

**A:** Once all the paperwork has been completed by the client and freelancer (signing contracts, confidentiality agreements, etc.), it's time to get down to business. üöÄ You will receive a notification in the app and by email indicating that the project has changed its status to "Active." Our Project Success team will contact you and send both parties a Kick Off with two objectives: to lay the foundations for the project and to explain the features of our platform, which facilitate project control and smooth communication. Recommendations: The project has been activated and you are getting down to work. We would like to give you some tips to ensure the success of the project: Establish the working methodology: It is important that both parties establish the communication channels you will use, the meetings you will have, and what both parties expect. 

Our platform offers tools to ensure that this is achieved, including feedback and a dashboard, which allow you to monitor the tasks that the freelancer is carrying out on a weekly basis and to identify any concerns or questions that may arise. ü§î Rely on your Project Success Manager. We say this a lot, but it's important. The person in charge of your project will be just as eager as you are for everything to go well and for your wishes to be fulfilledüßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è . Call whenever you feel it's necessary, discuss any concerns you may have with them, and tell them about the day-to-day progress of your project . We don't want it to happen... but if something does go wrong, the more they know, the more they can help you.
