# How much will I pay in self-employment contributions and when do I have to pay them?

**Q:** How much will I pay in self-employment contributions and when do I have to pay them?

**A:** Since 2024, there has been a very attractive bonus that greatly reduces the cost of registering as a self-employed worker for the first time, which has helped many new self-employed workers take their first steps.

In Spain, self-employment contributions are paid monthly and cost €86/month during the first year as a self-employed worker vs. €225/month (minimum) for self-employed workers who have been self-employed for more than a year, so the discount is huge.

The requirements to qualify for this discount are:

Not having been registered in the two years immediately prior to the effective date of the new registration, or three years if you have previously benefited from this deduction.

Not be a collaborating self-employed worker (a family member who lives and works with the self-employed person who runs the business).

Not have any outstanding debts with Social Security and the Tax Authorities.
