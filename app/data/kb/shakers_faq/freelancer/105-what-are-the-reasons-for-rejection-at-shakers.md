# What are the reasons for rejection at Shakers?

**Q:** What are the reasons for rejection at Shakers?

**A:** We know that getting a "no" can be discouraging, but we want you to see it as an opportunity to improve. At Shakers, we strive to maintain high quality standards so that both talent and clients have the best experience possible. That's why we're sharing the main reasons why we might reject a profile.

Your specialty is not within our offering

We work with a specific set of specialties. If your profile focuses on an area that is not currently in demand at Shakers, we may not be able to offer you relevant opportunities.

ðŸ‘‰ Check  the most in-demand specialties

Lack of relevant experience

Most of our projects are looking for profiles with at least 2 years of verifiable experience. If you are just starting out, this may not be the ideal time to join... but you can come back later!

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Work on freelance or personal projects that you can add to your portfolio.

The profile does not meet our quality standards

We are looking for profiles that demonstrate professionalism, clarity, and focus. If the information is incomplete, confusing, or does not accurately reflect your abilities, it is difficult to make a fair assessment.

We recommend:

Pay attention to the wording and structure of your profile

Highlight your achievements in a concrete way

Show clarity in your previous roles and responsibilities

Incomplete or unclear portfolio

Your portfolio is a key part of your profile. If you don't include examples of your work or the descriptions are too generic, we won't be able to get a good idea of your level.

âœ… What your portfolio should include:

Projects with clear context (client, challenge, solution)

Results achieved

Visible links or files

Diversity of work (if applicable)

No good cultural fit

Beyond experience, we also value affinity with our way of working. Sometimes there is not a good fit in terms of vision, autonomy, or collaboration style. And that's okay.
