**Answer:**

There are three key reasons:

Progressive and stable payment

You receive payments as you progress, rather than waiting until the entire project is completed

It gives you more financial stability and helps with tax management (you avoid paying VAT in advance for work that has not been paid for)

Controlled disbursements for the client

The client pays in phases, which facilitates investment and builds trust

Quality control and flexibility

The quality of the work is reviewed at each stage

Allows for adjustments to be made on the fly as the project evolves
