**Answer:**

You can upload your invoice right after the client validates the work milestone. That's when the payment is ready to be processed.

ðŸ“© You will receive a notification email.

When the customer validates your milestone, you will receive an email with the subject line:
"ðŸ’¸ It's money time! Upload your invoice to the Shakers app."

This email includes a direct link to the section where you can upload your invoice.
