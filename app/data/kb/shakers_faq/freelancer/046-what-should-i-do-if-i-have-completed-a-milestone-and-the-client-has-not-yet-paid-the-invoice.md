**Answer:**

This situation should not occur, as at Shakers you should not start a milestone if it has not been paid for in advance. But if it has happened, here's how to resolve it as quickly as possible.

First: remember the key rule

Before you start working on a milestone, always check that the client has activated and paid for it.
This is the only way to guarantee payment through Shakers Payments.

Contact the project's Account Manager immediately

Go to the project chat

In the upper right corner, you will see three dots with photos of the client, the Account Manager, and yourself

Click on the Account Manager's photo to open a private 1-to-1 chat

Tell them what has happened so they can deal with it directly with the client. It may be that they have simply forgotten to make the payment.
