# What amount will be allocated to each milestone?

**Q:** What amount will be allocated to each milestone?

**A:** 2. Click on the "Extend agreement" button

From your dashboard, select the project and click on "Extend agreement."

3. Create the extension

The process is exactly the same as when you made the initial proposal:

Add the new milestones

Specify the description, amount, and dates for each one

Check that everything is correct before sending it

4. Wait for the client's acceptance

As with the initial proposal:

The customer must accept it for the new milestones to be activated

This time you already have trust, so if you want, you can notify them via chat to speed up the process ðŸ˜œ

5. Let's get started!
