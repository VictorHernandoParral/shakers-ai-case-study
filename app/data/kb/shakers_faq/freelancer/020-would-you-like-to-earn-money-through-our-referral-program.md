# Would you like to earn money through our Referral Program?

**Q:** Would you like to earn money through our Referral Program?

**A:** At Shakers, apart from having the possibility of earning money by carrying out projects, you also have another possible source of income. 💸

We have a referral program through which you can refer tech profiles or companies that need freelance profiles.

How can you do this?

📝 Log in to your Shakers profile and, in the "Referral Plan" panel, fill out the recommendation form for any of the published positions.

📞 We will contact your referral to validate them.

🤑 If your referral is selected to work on the project you referred them for, you can earn up to €1,000 and your friend gets a great project to work on.
