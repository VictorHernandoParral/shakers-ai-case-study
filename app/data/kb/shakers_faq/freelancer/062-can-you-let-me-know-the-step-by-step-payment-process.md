**Answer:**

Create your proposal with defined milestones
Each milestone represents a part of the work, with its own amount.

Request the activation of the milestone
You can do this at any time from the project dashboard.

Shakers requests payment from the client
They have up to 48 hours to pay the full amount for the milestone.

The client activates the milestone
When doing so, they must pay for the milestone. If they activate it without paying, you will see a warning on the dashboard.

Shakers holds the money
This ensures that the amount is secured before you start working.

You deliver your work and request validation
When you have completed the milestone, mark it as delivered and request that the client validate it.

Invoice and payment
Once validated, you can upload your invoice and Shakers will send the money to your account.
