# How can I increase my % match with a project?

**Q:** How can I increase my % match with a project?

**A:** Your match percentage determines how well your profile fits a project. If you want to apply and you don't yet meet the minimum of 70%, you can edit your profile to improve that match. Here's how to do it step by step.

üéØ Practical example

Imagine you see a project and your match is low. When you enter, you see this:

‚ùå A red cross ‚Üí indicates that this skill or information is not in your profile

‚ö†Ô∏è An orange exclamation mark ‚Üí indicates that you only have part of what is required
