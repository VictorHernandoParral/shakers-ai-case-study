**Answer:**

Good communication with the client can be your greatest ally and will give you an advantage.

Here are some tips! 💡

👂Listen and analyze: From the moment you read the client's briefing for the first time to the final phase of the project, it is important to analyze everything the client is looking for and study how to offer it to them. Thanks to this analysis, you will also know what you need to successfully complete this project and set it apart from the start.

🤝 Interest and empathy: Show interest in the project and your client's interests, recommend improvements whenever you think it's necessary, and let them know that you understand their needs. (TIP: If you put yourself in their shoes, you'll get a better perspective on the project and be able to offer them more and better).

⁉️ Ask questions (but don't flood their email): Asking the right questions will prevent future misunderstandings and make a good impression, ensuring you deliver what they want and fulfill the purpose of the project.

🗣 Be mindful of jargon: Keep in mind that the client is hiring you because they need an expert, which means they are not one. Avoid using acronyms and use concrete terms whenever possible, addressing them in a way that is easy to understand.
