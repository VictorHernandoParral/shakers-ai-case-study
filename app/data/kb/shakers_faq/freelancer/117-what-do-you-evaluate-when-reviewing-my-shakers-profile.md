**Answer:**

Great, this is a key step to becoming an active part of the community. Here we tell you what aspects we analyze to make sure you're ready for the top projects happening at Shakers.

1. 100% complete profile

It seems obvious, but it's essential. A complete profile helps us clearly understand who you are, what you do, and how you fit into Shakers projects.

‚úÖ Professional bio
‚úÖ Detailed experience
‚úÖ Well-specified skills
‚úÖ Portfolio with examples

2. Specialization within our offering

We focus on certain profiles based on our clients' needs. If your specialty is within our catalog of services, you are more likely to be selected.

üëâWould you like to know what profiles we are currently looking for?


3. Years of Experience

Most projects are for experienced profiles. That's why we tend to prioritize people with at least 2 years of experience in their specialty.

üõ†Ô∏è If you are just starting out, don't worry. You can strengthen your profile with good descriptions, projects, and certifications.

4. Professional Career

We look beyond time: we want to understand your evolution. Have you taken on more responsibilities? Have you led teams or key projects? Tell us about it!

5. Certifications and Licenses

Having certifications is a nice bonus. They help us validate your technical knowledge objectively.

6. Skill Validation

We check whether your skills are well represented and validated both on Shakers and on other platforms (LinkedIn, Behance, GitHub, etc.). The more backing, the better.

7. Projects in your portfolio

The projects in your portfolio should speak for you. Include clear descriptions, results achieved, and links if available. Don't underestimate this point.



8. Languages

We don't require knowledge of English or other languages, but if you are fluent, it's a plus. Some international projects may require it.

In summary:

What we are looking for is a combination of experience, clarity, and potential. We want your profile to make it clear to us why you should be working on the best projects with us.
