**Answer:**

Shakers is a startup whose mission is to become the home of (freelance) talent, a place where we can meet face to face and satisfy any work-related need, from networking to receiving legal support.

But to get there, we have to take many steps, and that's why we've decided to start with the first and most important one: offering you good projects.

We don't let just any client in; we filter projects just as we filter you. We evaluate the project (making sure it's not a gig job, that the hourly rate is decent, etc.) and we evaluate the client itself (making sure they know how to deal with freelancers, etc.).

We do all this through a matching algorithm (like Tinder)ðŸª„ that takes into account not only professional aspects, but also motivational and personal ones. As we like to say, we don't want to match Java with Java, but Javier with Javier. We know that if you are truly motivated by your work, nothing can stop you.

That's why we are NOT a freelancer search engine like the others, we are not a kind of e-commerce site where you are a face with a price, we are a project search engine where you (are at the center of everything), you choose to apply for projects, although as we are a startup and we are improving our team, they may come looking for you.
