# How do I search for and apply to projects?

**Q:** How do I search for and apply to projects?

**A:** To apply for a project, you must first search for it on the "Search for projects" page.

By default, you will see all projects sorted by your match level, i.e., the degree of affinity between your profile and what the client needs.

You can filter projects by specialties, skills, match percentage with them, or publication date.

💡 Recommendation: Try to apply only to projects where you have at least a 70% match. This will increase your chances of being selected.

🔍 Applying to a project step by step

When you see a project that interests you, click on "View Project." There you can read all the detailed information: what the client is looking for, specific tasks, estimated time commitment, available budget, etc.

If it suits you, click on "Apply." Before submitting your application, you can:

Review your profile and add any skills if necessary

Write an introductory message

Attach one or two similar projects from your portfolio

And then... "Apply and Send"! 🚀
