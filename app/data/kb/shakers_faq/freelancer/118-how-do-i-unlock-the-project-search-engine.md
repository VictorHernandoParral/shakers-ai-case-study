**Answer:**

Access to the search engine (when there are projects for you)

Even if your profile is validated, you may not have immediate access to the search engine. This is not an error. We only grant access when:

There are active projects that align with your profile.

There is no other freelancer in our community who is already applying and is a better fit for the project.

We want to ensure that when you enter the search engine, you have real opportunities for you.
