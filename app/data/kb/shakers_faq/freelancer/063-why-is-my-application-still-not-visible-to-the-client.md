**Answer:**

If, when applying for a project, you see the message "Your application is not yet visible to the client," it means that the Account Manager needs to validate some details with you before submitting your application. Here we explain what this means and what you can do.

When you see this message, your application has been temporarily frozen.
The project Account Manager does this for one of the following reasons:

To validate your actual availability

To confirm a certification required by the client

To clarify your technical experience with a key tool or technology

Review a specific aspect of your profile before introducing you
