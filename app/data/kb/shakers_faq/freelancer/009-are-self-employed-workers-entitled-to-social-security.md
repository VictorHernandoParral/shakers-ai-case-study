**Answer:**

Yes, self-employed workers in Spain are entitled to Social Security. In fact, they are required to contribute to the Special Scheme for Self-Employed Workers (RETA), which gives them access to a range of benefits and coverage. Below, I detail the rights and coverage that self-employed workers have under Social Security.
