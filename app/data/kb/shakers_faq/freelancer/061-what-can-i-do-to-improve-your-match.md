# What can I do to improve your match?

**Q:** What can I do to improve your match?

**A:** 1. Click on the pencil icon to the right of each skill

This allows you to update the necessary fields to get closer to 70%.

2. Adjust your super specialty

📌 If, for example, the client is looking for a No Code Web Developer as a super specialty, but you have another one, change it in the editor and save the changes.

3. Add the essential skills

Example: the project requires these 2 skills:

No code

Prototyping

And you only have one of the two. Solution:

Go to "Edit"

Add the ones you're missing

Assign stars according to your level of experience

💡 Only include the ones you really master. Forcing skills you don't have can hurt you in the process.

4. Complete the required languages

If you are missing a language that the client has marked as mandatory, simply:

Click on the pencil next to languages

Add the missing language

Select your actual level

🔄 Important: refresh the page

⚠️ If you have made changes and do not see an increase in the match percentage, refresh the page.
Sometimes the AI needs to reload to update the data correctly.

👀 Some key clarifications

You don't need to have certified skills to apply, but they do help improve your match.

Make sure that everything you include in your profile is something you truly master. Otherwise, it can work against you.
