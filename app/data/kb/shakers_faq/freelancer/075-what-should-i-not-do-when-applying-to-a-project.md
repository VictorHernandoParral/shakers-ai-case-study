**Answer:**

During the conversation with the client in the Shakers chat, DO NOT share:

Your personal email address

Your phone number

Your Calendly or other external scheduling tools

Your hourly rate or financial proposals in PDF format

All communication must be kept within the platform so that the Account Manager, who is also in that chat, can help you if necessary.
