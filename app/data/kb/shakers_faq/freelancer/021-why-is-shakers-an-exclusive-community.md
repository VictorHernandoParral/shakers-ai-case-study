**Answer:**

We don't want 15,000 freelancers, we want 1,000, but the 1,000 best. That's why we want to make sure you're good, that you like our idea and our vision, and that you're going to help us achieve our goal of being the home of talent. Both of these things are extremely important to us at . If you're on board, we'll do everything in our power to improve your life as a freelancer.
