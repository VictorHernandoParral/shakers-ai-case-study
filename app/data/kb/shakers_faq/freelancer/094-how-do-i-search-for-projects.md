**Answer:**

To apply for a project, you must first search for it on the "Search for projects" page.


By default, you will see all projects sorted by your match level, i.e., the degree of affinity between your profile and what the client needs.


You can filter projects by specialties, skills, match percentage with them, or publication date.
