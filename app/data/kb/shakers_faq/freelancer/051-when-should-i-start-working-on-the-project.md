# When should I start working on the project?

**Q:** When should I start working on the project?

**A:** Even if the client has accepted your proposal, you should not start working until the first milestone is activated. We explain how to know when it is the right time to start.

⚠️ Important!

You will receive an email when your proposal is accepted, but that does not mean you can start working right away.
Acceptance of the project is not the same as the start of work.
