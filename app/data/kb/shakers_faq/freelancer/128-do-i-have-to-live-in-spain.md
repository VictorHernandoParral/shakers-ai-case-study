# Do I have to live in Spain?

**Q:** Do I have to live in Spain?

**A:** Another frequently asked question. And the answer, again: no, but it can help in some cases.

Most projects are 100% remote, and our community is global. We collaborate with talent from all over the world.

However, for some projects it may be useful, or even necessary, for you to live in Spain. For example, if the client wants to hold occasional face-to-face meetings or there are legal requirements such as access to sensitive systems.
