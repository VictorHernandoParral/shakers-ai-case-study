**Answer:**

If it has been 3-4 days since you applied and you haven't received a response, don't worry. It's normal for some processes to take a while, especially if the client has a busy schedule.

âœ… What you can do

1. Send a second message to the client

Go to the project chat and write to them directly.
You can say something like:
"Hello, I am very interested in this project. Could we schedule a meeting to review the briefing together?"

Being proactive helps show your commitment and professionalism.

2. Contact the project's Account Manager

If after several attempts the client does not respond, look for the Account Manager's photo in the upper right corner of the chat.
Click on it and send them a direct message.

The Account Manager is the person who communicates directly with the client and can help you resolve the situation.
