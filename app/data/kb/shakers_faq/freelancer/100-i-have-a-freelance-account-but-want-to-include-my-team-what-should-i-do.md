**Answer:**

If you already have a freelance account with Shakers and now want to work with your team or present yourself as an organization or studio, that's great! We can help you manage it.


In these cases, you need to contact our support team so we can help you with the process.

ðŸ“© Write to us via the support chat or send us an email with the subject line:
"I want to add my team to my profile"

To create your profile as an organization, we will need some information:

Name of your organization

Number of people on the team

The specialties of each member (design, development, strategy, etc.)

Languages in which they can work

Any other relevant details that help us understand how you work

At Shakers, we work with technical profiles, not commercial ones. In other words, we want to make sure that the people who apply for projects are the ones who will actually carry them out.
That's why it's important for us to know who is behind your account and how you organize yourselves.
