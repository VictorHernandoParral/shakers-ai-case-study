**Answer:**

Each milestone in a project has a status that indicates where it is in the process. Here we explain what each one means and what actions you can (or cannot) take.

ğŸ”´ Pending payment

ğŸ“Œ You cannot start working.

This status indicates that the client has not yet deposited payment for the milestone.
Until that happens:

Do not start work, as Shakers will not be able to guarantee payment.

Talk to your Account Manager so they can contact the client and request payment

ğŸš¨ If you work on the milestone in this status, you do so at your own risk.

ğŸŸ  Pending

ğŸ“Œ The work is already done, but it is pending validation by the client.

Your role at this point:

Ensure that the client has received everything that was agreed upon.

You can send them a reminder message to review and validate the milestone

ğŸŸ¢ Active

ğŸ“Œ You can start working now!

This means that:

The client has activated the milestone

They have made the corresponding payment, which Shakers securely retains

You are officially authorized to proceed with the work

âœ… Completed

ğŸ“Œ The client has validated the milestone and the payment has been processed.

You can now:

Upload your invoice from the Payments section

Prepare for the next milestone, if any
