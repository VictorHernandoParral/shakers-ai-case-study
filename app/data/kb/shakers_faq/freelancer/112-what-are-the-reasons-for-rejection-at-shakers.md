**Answer:**

We know that getting a "no" can be discouraging, but we want you to see it as an opportunity to improve. At Shakers, we strive to maintain high quality standards so that both talent and clients have the best experience possible. That's why we're sharing the main reasons why we might reject a profile.

Your specialty is not within our offering 

We work with a specific set of specialties. If your profile focuses on an area that is not currently in demand at Shakers, we may not be able to offer you relevant opportunities.

Lack of relevant experience 

Most of our projects are looking for profiles with at least 2 years of verifiable experience. If you are just starting out, this may not be the ideal time to join... but you can come back later!


The profile does not meet our quality standards 

We are looking for profiles that demonstrate professionalism, clarity, and focus. If the information is incomplete, confusing, or does not accurately reflect your abilities, it is difficult to make a fair assessment.

We recommend:

Pay attention to the wording and structure of your profile

Highlight your achievements in a concrete way

Show clarity in your previous roles and responsibilities

Incomplete or unclear portfolio

Your portfolio is a key part of your profile. If you don't include examples of your work or the descriptions are too generic, we won't be able to get a good idea of your level.
