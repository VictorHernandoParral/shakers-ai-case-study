# What is our value proposition?

**Q:** What is our value proposition?

**A:** Shakers is a startup whose mission is to become the home of (freelance) talent, a place where we can meet face to face and satisfy any work-related need, from networking to receiving legal support.

But to get there, we have to take many steps, and that's why we've decided to start with the first and most important one: offering you good projects.

We don't let just any client in; we filter projects just as we filter you. We evaluate the project (making sure it's not a gig job, that the hourly rate is decent, etc.) and we evaluate the client itself (making sure they know how to deal with freelancers, etc.).

We do all this through a matching algorithm (like Tinder)ü™Ñ that takes into account not only professional aspects, but also motivational and personal ones. As we like to say, we don't want to match Java with Java, but Javier with Javier. We know that if you are truly motivated by your work, nothing can stop you.

That's why we are NOT a freelancer search engine like the others, we are not a kind of e-commerce site where you are a face with a price, we are a project search engine where you (are at the center of everything), you choose to apply for projects, although as we are a startup and we are improving our team, they may come looking for you.

At Shakers, we ARE an exclusive community:

We don't want 15,000 freelancers, we want 1,000, but the 1,000 best. That's why we want to make sure you're good, that you like our idea and our vision, and that you're going to help us achieve our goal of being the home of talent. Both of these things are extremely important to us at . If you're on board, we'll do everything in our power to improve your life as a freelancer.

We also want to make the most of your time. Let me give you an example of our sales team's goals:

Our goals (for which we earn our bonuses) are to get you to dedicate as much time as possible to us and, in doing so, become a significant source of your monthly revenue.

To do this, we go out and find projects for you, not just any projects.

Our goals are to get you to dedicate as much time as possible to us and, in doing so, become a significant contributor to your monthly revenue.

That's why our team of account managers will be by your side and will be your partner in helping you close sales. Once you join the cycle, our team will get to work for you.

OBVIOUSLY, we don't do this because we are altruistic or the nicest people in the world. We do this because we know that if we GIVE, if we are important to you, we will RECEIVE and we will build a relationship of trust with you, counting on your help to grow this community and bring us closer to the vision I mentioned earlier. It will be a win-win relationshipü§ù in which we all win. ‚ù§Ô∏è
