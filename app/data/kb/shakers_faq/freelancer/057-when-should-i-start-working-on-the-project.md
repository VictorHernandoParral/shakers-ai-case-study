**Answer:**

Even if the client has accepted your proposal, you should not start working until the first milestone is activated. We explain how to know when it is the right time to start.


You will receive an email when your proposal is accepted, but that does not mean you can start working right away.
Acceptance of the project is not the same as the start of work.


You should only start when the client activates the first milestone.
This ensures that:

The client has made the corresponding payment

The work is officially underway

You are covered by the Shakers payment system
