# Can I do anything if the project is no longer available?

**Q:** Can I do anything if the project is no longer available?

**A:** No. If you see the message, it means that there are already profiles moving forward with the client and it is not possible to apply at that time.

ðŸ’¬ Shakers tip

Keep your profile up to date and your availability clear. That way, when you automatically match with a new project, you'll be ready to apply without wasting any time.
