# What if no one contacts me?

**Q:** What if no one contacts me?

**A:** 🚨 If 2-3 days have passed since you applied and you haven't received any messages, take the initiative:

👉 Write to them directly via the project's internal chat
Ask them directly:

"Hello, I see that my application is not yet visible. Is there anything you need to validate in order to move forward?"

🤝 Final tip

This step does not mean anything negative. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to highlight your profile and resolve any questions that may arise before showing it to the client.
