**Answer:**

It is not compulsory to take out any insurance as a self-employed worker, although sometimes some self-employed workers decide to take out certain types of insurance (depending on their professional activity):

Professional Liability Insurance: This insurance covers material or personal damage that you may cause to third parties in the course of your professional activity. It is especially important if your work involves risks to third parties, as in the case of doctors, lawyers, architects, etc.

Workers' Compensation Insurance: This protects both you as a freelancer and your employees in the event of workplace accidents that occur during the course of your professional activity.

Health Insurance: As a self-employed person, you do not have access to social security through an employer, so taking out private health insurance can be important to cover medical expenses and ensure prompt, quality medical care.

Disability Insurance: This type of insurance provides income in the event that you are temporarily unable to work due to an illness or injury that prevents you from carrying out your professional activity.

Commercial Vehicle Insurance: If you use a vehicle in the course of your professional activity, it is important to insure it adequately to cover any damage that may occur.

Property Damage Insurance: Protect your business assets, such as equipment, inventory, or workspace, against damage or loss caused by events such as fire, flood, theft, etc.
