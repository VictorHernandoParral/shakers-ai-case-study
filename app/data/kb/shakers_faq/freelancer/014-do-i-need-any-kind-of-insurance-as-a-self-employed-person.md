# Do I need any kind of insurance as a self-employed person?

**Q:** Do I need any kind of insurance as a self-employed person?

**A:** It is not compulsory to take out any insurance as a self-employed worker, although sometimes some self-employed workers decide to take out certain types of insurance (depending on their professional activity):

Professional Liability Insurance: This insurance covers material or personal damage that you may cause to third parties in the course of your professional activity. It is especially important if your work involves risks to third parties, as in the case of doctors, lawyers, architects, etc.

Workers' Compensation Insurance: This protects both you as a freelancer and your employees in the event of workplace accidents that occur during the course of your professional activity.

Health Insurance: As a self-employed person, you do not have access to social security through an employer, so taking out private health insurance can be important to cover medical expenses and ensure prompt, quality medical care.

Disability Insurance: This type of insurance provides income in the event that you are temporarily unable to work due to an illness or injury that prevents you from carrying out your professional activity.

Commercial Vehicle Insurance: If you use a vehicle in the course of your professional activity, it is important to insure it adequately to cover any damage that may occur.

Property Damage Insurance: Protect your business assets, such as equipment, inventory, or workspace, against damage or loss caused by events such as fire, flood, theft, etc.

VAT: how VAT works, how it is paid to the tax authorities, how it is deducted

1. Charging VAT: When a self-employed person issues an invoice for the provision of services, they must add the corresponding VAT to the sale price. This VAT charged is collected from the customer and broken down on the invoice, showing the amount before tax, the VAT rate applied (usually 21%, although it can be 10% or 4% depending on the product or service), and the total amount including VAT.

2. VAT settlement: Self-employed workers must submit a VAT return (form 303) to the Tax Agency on a quarterly basis. In this return, the input VAT (paid on purchases) is subtracted from the output VAT (charged on sales).

If the VAT charged is greater than the VAT paid, the difference must be paid to the Tax Agency.

If the input VAT is greater than the output VAT, a refund of the difference can be requested or it can be offset in future returns.

3. Forms 303 and 390:

Form 303: This is submitted quarterly and is the form used to settle VAT.

Form 390: This is an annual summary return of all transactions subject to VAT carried out during the year. It is filed in January of the year following the fiscal year.

4. VAT rates: There are different VAT rates depending on the product or service:

General rate (21%): Most goods and services.

Reduced rate (10%): Food products, transport services, hotels and restaurants, etc.

Super-reduced rate (4%): Essential products such as bread, milk, books, medicines, etc.
