**Answer:**

Our goals (for which we earn our bonuses) are to get you to dedicate as much time as possible to us and, in doing so, become a significant source of your monthly revenue.

To do this, we go out and find projects for you, not just any projects.

Our goals are to get you to dedicate as much time as possible to us and, in doing so, become a significant contributor to your monthly revenue.

That's why our team of account managers will be by your side and will be your partner in helping you close sales. Once you join the cycle, our team will get to work for you.

OBVIOUSLY, we don't do this because we are altruistic or the nicest people in the world. We do this because we know that if we GIVE, if we are important to you, we will RECEIVE and we will build a relationship of trust with you, counting on your help to grow this community and bring us closer to the vision I mentioned earlier. It will be a win-win relationshipü§ù in which we all win. ‚ù§Ô∏è
