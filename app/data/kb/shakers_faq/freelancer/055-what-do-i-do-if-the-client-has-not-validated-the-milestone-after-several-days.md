**Answer:**

Contact the project's Account Manager

You can do this directly from the project chat:

Go to the application chat

At the top right, you will see three dots with photos of the client, the Account Manager, and yourself

Click on the Account Manager's icon

A one-on-one chat will open so you can explain your situation
