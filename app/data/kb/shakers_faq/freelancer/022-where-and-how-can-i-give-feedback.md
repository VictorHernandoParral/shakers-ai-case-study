# Where and how can I give feedback?

**Q:** Where and how can I give feedback?

**A:** Feedback contributes to the success of the project.

On the project page, you'll find the "Feedback" tab, where you can report to the client on a weekly basis about the progress of the project and the tasks you had planned for that week.

Reasons why feedback is important:

Improves performance: In order to meet the expectations and deliverables of a project, it is important to be very clear about what they are. Feedback clarifies expectations and keeps the team working within the scope of the project.

Builds trust: Honesty and openness create a culture of trust and security between the parties involved in the project.

Improves communication: Feedback can be a two-way conversation between the freelancer and the client; it doesn't have to be a monologue. Good feedback gives the client the opportunity to respond, express their concerns, and address your questions.

Anticipates problems: Following a feedback schedule provides an opportunity to discuss negative behaviors or issues that affect the project and try to resolve them before they lead to disputes or project failure.

Check tasks/objectives: Feedback gives us the opportunity to discuss urgent tasks/milestones and overall objectives. Talking openly with the client or team helps to identify what is realistic or achievable in the current phase of the project.
