# I am moving to Spain in the next few months. Will I be able to register as self-employed?

**Q:** I am moving to Spain in the next few months. Will I be able to register as self-employed?

**A:** Yes, you can register as self-employed, but first you will have to complete the following procedures:

Apply for a NIE (foreigner identification number) to carry out any procedures with the Spanish administration.

You will need to have your work permit approved so that Social Security will allow you to register with the RETA (Special Scheme for Self-Employed Workers).

Have a Spanish bank account.
