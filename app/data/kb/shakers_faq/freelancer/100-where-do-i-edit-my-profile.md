# Where do I edit my profile?

**Q:** Where do I edit my profile?

**A:** From your control panel in Shakers, go to the Profile section. There you can modify all sections: from your experience to your personal details, including your portfolio and availability.

Sections you shouldn't overlook

ðŸŒŸ Cover photo and Highlights

This is your space to show who you are. Add a personal touch and make the client connect with you from the very first minute.

Ideas to highlight:

Introduce yourself on video.

Share your work methodology.

Link to customer reviews or results you've achieved.

Share something more personal: hobbies, interests, or a story that represents you.

ðŸŒŸ Experience

With the new feature, you can import your experience directly from LinkedIn. This saves you time and ensures that your career path is accurately reflected.

ðŸŒŸ Portfolio

We recommend including at least three projects that represent you. Explain why they are important to you and what you contributed.

ðŸ“Œ Fact: 90% of candidates who complete this section have a higher success rate in their applications.

ðŸŒŸ Skills

Make sure your list of skills is always up to date. This directly impacts the matching algorithm and the projects you are shown.

ðŸŒŸ Personal

Here you can share who you are beyond the technical aspects. Review these sections carefully:

"Describe yourself in one sentence"

"About you"

"What you excel at and why"

Don't forget to keep your LinkedIn profile, availability, and language skills up to date.

ðŸŒŸ Motivation

Take the motivation test so we can offer you projects that really connect with your interests. This test helps us understand:
