# What should you review and update?

**Q:** What should you review and update?

**A:** 1. Specialties and skills

Before applying for a project, compare your skills with those the client is looking for. The more skills you have in common, the better your match with the project will be. This not only improves your chances of being selected, it also makes your application much more meaningful.

2. Availability

Are you partially or fully available? How many hours can you dedicate per week? This information is essential for both the algorithm and the Talent team, as it allows us to suggest projects that fit your current schedule.
