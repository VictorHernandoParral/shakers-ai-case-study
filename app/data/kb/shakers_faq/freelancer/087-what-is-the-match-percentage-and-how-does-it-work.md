**Answer:**

It's your degree of affinity with a project. As a freelancer, it helps you quickly identify the projects you're most motivated to work on, and as a client, it helps you filter candidates interested in your project.

Shakers was born with a mission: to help millions of people wake up inspired and satisfied with the work they do. For this to happen, we need to work on things that motivate us and make us want to get out of bed in the morning. Today's workers are no longer satisfied with just a project and a guarantee of payment at the end. Today's workers want challenges; they want their work to align with their lifestyle and values. If you're a basketball fan, wouldn't you rather work for the NBA than Coca-Cola?

That's why we decided to create an algorithm that goes beyond the typical variables taken into account in other talent or project marketplaces (professional skills, experience, etc.) and includes variables such as motivation and personality.
