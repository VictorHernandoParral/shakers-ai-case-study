**Answer:**

Your opinion is key to improving Shakers.
If something isn't working as it should, let us know. This is a collaborative process and we want you to be part of the change.

Report it like this:

Go to your profile

Go to the top right corner of the screen

Click on the "Give us your feedback" button



üìù Fill out the form

When you click, a new tab will open with a short form. Indicate:

1. Type of feedback

Select "Report Bug/Error."

2. Describe the error

Tell us as much detail as possible.

3. Attach files (optional, but very useful)

You can upload screenshots, videos, or any other files that will help us better understand the problem.
