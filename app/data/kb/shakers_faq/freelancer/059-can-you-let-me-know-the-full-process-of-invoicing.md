**Answer:**

At Shakers, we have designed a billing system that offers you security, convenience, speed, and continuity. Here's how to collect your milestones in just three steps.

1. Check the "My Invoices" section

Log in to your profile

Click on the left side menu

Go to the "Payments" section

2. Upload your invoice

When the customer validates that the milestone is complete, you will be able to upload the corresponding invoice.

Check the information that must appear on the invoice (name, date, exact amount of the milestone, etc.).

Generate your invoice in PDF format

Upload it directly using the button provided in that section.

The status of the invoice will be updated automatically, and you will be able to track it from the dashboard.

3. Payment confirmation

Once we review and process the invoice:

ðŸ“© We will notify you by email as soon as the payment is made.

âœ… And that's it! The money will be transferred to your bank account.

ðŸ“Œ Remember:

You can only upload the invoice once the client has validated the milestone

The Shakers team manages the payment to the client and pays you directly
