**Answer:**

Be of legal age: be at least 18 years old.

Carry out an economic activity on a regular, personal, and direct basis: you must be self-employed and work on a regular basis.

Be registered with the Tax Office: before registering with Social Security, you need to submit your tax return to the Tax Office.
