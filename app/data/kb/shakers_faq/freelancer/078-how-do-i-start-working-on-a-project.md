# How do I start working on a project?

**Q:** How do I start working on a project?

**A:** Great news! If the client has accepted your proposal, it's time to get to work. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get started:

✅ 1. Active project notification

You will receive an email and in-app notification when the project changes to "Active" status.
This means you can now start using Shakers' project management tool.

🏁 2. Prepare for the start of the project

Although it is not mandatory, we highly recommend that you do this:

📌 Create an initial load of tasks in the "What do you have pending?" column.
This will help you:

Have a clear vision of what you are going to do

Get better organized

Set your own deadlines

Streamline collaboration with the client

💡 It's a small gesture that makes a big difference. Trust us, we've seen it in hundreds of projects.
