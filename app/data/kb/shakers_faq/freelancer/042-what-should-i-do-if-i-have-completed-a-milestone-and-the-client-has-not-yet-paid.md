# What should I do if I have completed a milestone and the client has not yet paid the invoice?

**Q:** What should I do if I have completed a milestone and the client has not yet paid the invoice?

**A:** This situation should not occur, as at Shakers you should not start a milestone if it has not been paid for in advance. But if it has happened, here's how to resolve it as quickly as possible.

⚠️ First: remember the key rule

Before you start working on a milestone, always check that the client has activated and paid for it.
This is the only way to guarantee payment through Shakers Payments.
