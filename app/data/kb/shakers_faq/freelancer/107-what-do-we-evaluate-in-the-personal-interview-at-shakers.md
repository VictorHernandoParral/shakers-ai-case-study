# What do we evaluate in the personal interview at Shakers?

**Q:** What do we evaluate in the personal interview at Shakers?

**A:** We know that interviews can be a little intimidating, but at Shakers, we prefer you to think of it as a chat between colleagues.

Here we tell you what points we take into account during the personal interview.

Getting to know you better, beyond your resume
The most important thing: getting to know who you are as a person. What drives you? What are you passionate about? What has your journey been like so far? Tell us about your professional history, but also about yourself as a person. We want to understand your motivation and how you got to where you are today.

Alignment with our values and mission 
At Shakers, we work with purpose. That's why we really value you sharing our values and identifying with our mission: to transform the way we work.
During the interview, we will talk about how you understand our proposal and how you think you could contribute in your role.

That you understand how Shakers works 
We want you to have a clear understanding of how the platform works, how to access projects, and how to collaborate with clients.
During the interview, we will explain everything to you, but we will also assess whether you have already done some research on how we work. It is a plus if you already know the basics. ðŸ˜‰

Your career and experience
