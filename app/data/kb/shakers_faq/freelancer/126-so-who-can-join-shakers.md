# So... who can join Shakers?

**Q:** So... who can join Shakers?

**A:** Freelancers

If you already work for yourself, Shakers is for you. You'll find projects designed for your lifestyle: collaborations with startups, large companies, and teams that value autonomy and specialization.

Agencies and studios

If you are part of an agency or studio, you can also be part of Shakers. The important thing is that the profile that registers and collaborates on projects is the professional who will carry out the work, not a commercial profile.
This allows us to maintain our focus on technical and creative talent.
