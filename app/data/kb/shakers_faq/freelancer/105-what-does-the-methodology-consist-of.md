**Answer:**

It's very simple! Shakers provides you with tools to encourage continuous feedback, which facilitates good communication between clients and talent and allows Shakers account managers to closely monitor the project.

There are project application chats and video calls. You can chat with the client through the chats, so everything will be written down and the Shakers team will be able to keep track of your communication.

You can also use your own means to communicate with the client (your Slack, your email, etc.), but in that case, we provide you with the feedback tool so that you can keep a record of your work and we can help you in the event of a possible dispute. If you do your job well and keep a record of it, you are guaranteed to get paid. You can access the feedback section as follows:


Open your active project.

Scroll down to the bottom and click on the "Go to project" button.

At the top, you will see the "üëâüèº Feedback" panel where you can include your weekly feedback. In this weekly feedback, it is important to include the objectives achieved during the week, what is still pending, if you have any dependencies, the next steps, etc.

IMPORTANT: if your client asks you for things outside the scope of what was agreed in the proposal, ALWAYS contact your Account Manager or support so that we are aware of this and can help you. If we are not aware of this, in the event of a dispute (a client does not want to validate a milestone), it will be your word against theirs.


‚ö†Ô∏è If you have not sent feedback by Monday morning, the client will receive a notification indicating that you have not sent this week's feedback.



And that's it, ready to go!
