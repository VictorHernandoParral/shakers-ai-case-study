**Answer:**

ðŸš¨ If 2-3 days have passed since you applied and you haven't received any messages, take the initiative:

ðŸ‘‰ Write to them directly via the project's internal chat
Ask them directly:

"Hello, I see that my application is not yet visible. Is there anything you need to validate in order to move forward?"
