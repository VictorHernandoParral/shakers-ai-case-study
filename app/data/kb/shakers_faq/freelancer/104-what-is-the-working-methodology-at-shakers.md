**Answer:**

After hundreds of projects and thousands of hours of observing the work between freelancers and clients, at Shakers we have developed an agile methodology that:

Encourages freedom and flexibility in freelance work.

Maximizes client satisfaction.

Both needs feed into each other, since a more motivated worker generates better results, and a more satisfied client allows more freedom for their teams. This is our hack. 🤟🏼😎

We don't put a gun to anyone's head😅 , but we strongly recommend that all Shakers freelancers follow this methodology, as our platform is designed to help you comply with it.
