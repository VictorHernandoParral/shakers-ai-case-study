If you're considering joining Shakers, you're probably wondering: How do I join and how long does the whole process take? Here's a step-by-step guide üëá

1. Register and complete the onboarding process

Start by creating your account and completing the initial onboarding process.
This helps us better understand your profile and offer you a personalized recommendation about your chances of accessing the full functionality of Shakers.

3. Certify your skills (optional, but recommended)

You can add technical certifications that validate your skills.
This improves your chances of passing the selection process.


4. Screening + video call

Once your profile is complete and validated:

üìπ We will ask you for a short video presentation.
