# If I am self-employed, what percentage of income tax should I include in my app profile and on my invoices?

**Q:** If I am self-employed, what percentage of income tax should I include in my app profile and on my invoices?

**A:** Depending on your tax bracket, if you are a tax resident in Spain, you must include 7% or 15% income tax. We recommend that you talk to your advisor to include the income tax percentage that best suits your tax situation.

If you are not a tax resident in Spain, you do not have to include income tax or VAT on your invoices.
