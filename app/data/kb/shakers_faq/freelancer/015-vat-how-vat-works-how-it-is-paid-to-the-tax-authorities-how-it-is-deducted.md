**Answer:**

1. Charging VAT: When a self-employed person issues an invoice for the provision of services, they must add the corresponding VAT to the sale price. This VAT charged is collected from the customer and broken down on the invoice, showing the amount before tax, the VAT rate applied (usually 21%, although it can be 10% or 4% depending on the product or service), and the total amount including VAT.




2. VAT settlement: Self-employed workers must submit a VAT return (form 303) to the Tax Agency on a quarterly basis. In this return, the input VAT (paid on purchases) is subtracted from the output VAT (charged on sales).

If the VAT charged is greater than the VAT paid, the difference must be paid to the Tax Agency.

If the input VAT is greater than the output VAT, a refund of the difference can be requested or it can be offset in future returns.

3. Forms 303 and 390:


Form 303: This is submitted quarterly and is the form used to settle VAT.

Form 390: This is an annual summary return of all transactions subject to VAT carried out during the year. It is filed in January of the year following the fiscal year.

4. VAT rates: There are different VAT rates depending on the product or service:


General rate (21%): Most goods and services.

Reduced rate (10%): Food products, transport services, hotels and restaurants, etc.

Super-reduced rate (4%): Essential products such as bread, milk, books, medicines, etc.
