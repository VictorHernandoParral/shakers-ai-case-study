**Answer:**

If the project is going well and the client needs more work, you can extend your proposal directly from your dashboard. This allows you to add new milestones, adjusting deadlines and deliverables with ease.

âš¡ Keep up the momentum!

When the client and freelancer are aligned and the project needs to be extended, it is normal to agree on an extension. This may arise:

During a follow-up meeting

When it becomes clear that more deliverables are needed

Because the client wants to take advantage of your availability for more tasks

ðŸ“Œ Step by step guide to extending a proposal

1. Confirm with the client

Make sure you both understand:

What new deliverables will be included

What deadlines will be used

What amount will be allocated to each milestone

2. Click on the "Extend agreement" button

From your dashboard, select the project and click on "Extend agreement."


3. Create the extension

The process is exactly the same as when you made the initial proposal:

Add the new milestones

Specify the description, amount, and dates for each one

Check that everything is correct before sending it

4. Wait for the client's acceptance

As with the initial proposal:

The customer must accept it for the new milestones to be activated

This time you already have trust, so if you want, you can notify them via chat to speed up the process ðŸ˜œ

5. Let's get started!

When the client accepts, the new milestones will appear on your dashboard with:

Description

Delivery dates

Payment status
