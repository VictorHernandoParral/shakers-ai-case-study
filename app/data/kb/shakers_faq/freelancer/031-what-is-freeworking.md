**Answer:**

When we define the worker of the "future" as someone who enjoys complete flexibility, is delocalized, highly specialized, works by milestones, etc., we are painting an accurate picture of the freelancer. These are profiles who, for the most part, at the peak of their careers, decide to invest in their talent and develop it to its full potential by working on projects that motivate them.

The problem? The term "freelancer" still has negative connotations in the collective imagination of companies, and freelancers are only considered for "cheap" projects and specific tasks, without understanding their true potential and limiting the growth potential of their businesses.

That is why we have coined our own term to define this way of working for professionals who are reinventing the world of work and meeting their expectations: greater flexibility and freedom at work.

Freeworking is the lever that will differentiate companies in the coming years and act as a multiplier of their results by Víctor Manasé.

It's simple: anyone who wants to have the best talent on their teams will have to jump on the freeworking bandwagon:

Flexible work

Delocalized

Hybrid teams

Super-specialization

Project-based work

Motivation through SACO
