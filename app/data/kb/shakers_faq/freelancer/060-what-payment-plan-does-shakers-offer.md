**Answer:**

At Shakers, we use a secure and transparent payment system called Shakers Payments, where we act as intermediaries between you and the client. This way, we guarantee that you get paid on time and with all the guarantees.

Each project is divided into milestones (phases), and each milestone has its own invoice.
Your proposal must fit this structure.
