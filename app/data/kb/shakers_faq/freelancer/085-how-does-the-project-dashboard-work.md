**Answer:**

All project management is done from the project dashboard. You can access the dashboard for a project you are participating in from the side menu, under "My projects."

To access all the tasks in a project, go to the "Board" tab.

The board is organized in a 3-column Kanban style: 

What do you have pending? This is where you will find the tasks that are not being worked on in the current week.

What do you have this week? This is where all the tasks that are being worked on in the current week are located.

What have you already done? Where all completed tasks are located.

To create a task, click on the "Create Task" button and fill in the fields.

Task name

Description (if you want to explain something in more detail)

Due date (if you know it)

Person responsible

Once you have filled in the information you consider necessary, click on "Save." 

Task activity

Additionally, you can add comments to a task from the right-hand panel. All users involved in a task will receive a notification with your comment.
