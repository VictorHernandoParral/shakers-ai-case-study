# What can you do if you have been rejected?

**Q:** What can you do if you have been rejected?

**A:** Just because you haven't been accepted now doesn't mean you can't try again. Here are some ideas for improving your profile and trying again later:

🔁 Update your profile: Add new information if you have worked on other projects.

🎯 Enrich your portfolio: Pay attention to detail and showcase your best work.

📈 Gain more experience: Sign up for freelance projects, collaborations, or internships.

✅ Check that your specialty is in our catalog: This can make all the difference.
