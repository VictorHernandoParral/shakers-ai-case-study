**Answer:**

We know that interviews can be a little intimidating, but at Shakers, we prefer you to think of it as a chat between colleagues. We want to get to know you authentically and understand whether this community is the right place for you (and vice versa). Here we tell you what points we take into account during the personal interview.


Getting to know you better, beyond your resume
The most important thing: getting to know who you are as a person. What drives you? What are you passionate about? What has your journey been like so far? Tell us about your professional history, but also about yourself as a person. We want to understand your motivation and how you got to where you are today.


Alignment with our values and mission 
At Shakers, we work with purpose. That's why we really value you sharing our values and identifying with our mission: to transform the way we work.
During the interview, we will talk about how you understand our proposal and how you think you could contribute in your role.


That you understand how Shakers works 
We want you to have a clear understanding of how the platform works, how to access projects, and how to collaborate with clients.
During the interview, we will explain everything to you, but we will also assess whether you have already done some research on how we work. It is a plus if you already know the basics. ðŸ˜‰


Your career and experience 


We want to know about your professional background and the lessons you have learned that have brought you to this point. It's not just about your qualifications or the companies you have worked for, but about the experiences that have helped you grow.

We are interested in knowing:

Where you are in your career

What kind of projects motivate you

What skills you believe set you apart

Your availability and the types of projects you are looking for


To know how and when we could count on you, it is essential to know:

Your availability by the hour or by the week

Whether you are looking for one-off projects or long-term collaborations

What type of clients or industries interest you

This helps us notify you when there is a perfect match for you.

A mutual (and transparent) process
This interview is not just for us to get to know you. It is also for you to decide if you want to be part of the Shakers community.
We want you to feel comfortable asking any questions you may have. We are here to explain everything to you with complete transparency.
