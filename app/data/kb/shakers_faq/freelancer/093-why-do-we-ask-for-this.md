# ðŸ’¡ Why do we ask for this?

**Q:** ðŸ’¡ Why do we ask for this?

**A:** At Shakers, we work with technical profiles, not commercial ones. In other words, we want to make sure that the people who apply for projects are the ones who will actually carry them out.
That's why it's important for us to know who is behind your account and how you organize yourselves.
