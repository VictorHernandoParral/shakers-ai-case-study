**Answer:**

You're in the right place.

You can register without any problems, complete your profile, and explore everything Shakers has to offer. Once you unlock your access, you will see the active projects and be able to assess whether these types of opportunities fit what you are looking for.

The idea is that when you decide to take the plunge and launch yourself as a freelancer, you're already in, you know how it works, and you have a clear understanding of how the ecosystem operates.
