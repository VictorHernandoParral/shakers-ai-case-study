6. Skill Validation

We check whether your skills are well represented and validated both on Shakers and on other platforms (LinkedIn, Behance, GitHub, etc.). The more backing, the better.

7. Projects in your portfolio

The projects in your portfolio should speak for you. Include clear descriptions, results achieved, and links if available. Don't underestimate this point.

8. Languages

We don't require knowledge of English or other languages, but if you are fluent, it's a plus. Some international projects may require it.

In summary:

What we are looking for is a combination of experience, clarity, and potential. We want your profile to make it clear to us why you should be working on the best projects with us.
