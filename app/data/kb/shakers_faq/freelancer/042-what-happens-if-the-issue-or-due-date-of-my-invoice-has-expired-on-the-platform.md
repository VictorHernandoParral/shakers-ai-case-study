**Answer:**

Don't worry. The dates that appear on the platform are for guidance only and do not affect the payment agreed with the customer.

If the date has expired, don't worry, it's not a problem.

If you see that the issue or due date of your invoice has passed, don't worry:

It does not affect the payment

You don't need to reissue the invoice

You will still be paid the amount agreed in your initial financial proposal

The important thing is that the milestone has been validated by the client and you have correctly uploaded your invoice in PDF format.
