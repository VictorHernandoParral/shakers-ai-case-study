**Answer:**

Each milestone within a project can have one of these three statuses:

1. Activate

📌 This status indicates that work on that part of the project has not yet begun.

We activate the first milestone when the project moves to "Active" status.

The rest of the milestones can be activated by the client.

If any of them remain inactive, you can ask the client to activate them (sometimes a little nudge helps😉 ).

🔐 When a milestone is activated, the client makes the corresponding payment. Shakers holds that payment until you complete and deliver the milestone.

2. Deliver

📦 Once you have completed the milestone work, click "Deliver." This means:

You are communicating to the client that the work for that milestone is ready

The client will review and validate the delivery

Once validated, the field to upload the invoice for that milestone will be enabled

3. Completed

✅ When the milestone is validated and completed, it changes to "Completed" status.

This allows you to see on your dashboard:

Which milestones are in progress

Which ones you have already delivered

And how many have been completed

🧭 It's an easy way to track the progress of the project, both for you and for the client.

You can manage milestones during a project from the project's "Dashboard" tab.

If the client does not approve your work, don't worry; you are not alone. The person responsible for the Shakers Project Success team, who is in charge of monitoring the project, will intervene and act as a "judge" to determine whether payment should be released.
