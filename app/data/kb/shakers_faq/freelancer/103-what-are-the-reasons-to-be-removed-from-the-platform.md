**Answer:**

Here are some of the situations in which we might make that decision:

1. You stop working on projects

If you decide that you no longer want to work as a freelancer or stop applying for projects for a long period of time, we may remove you from the platform to maintain balance within the active community.

2. No match with projects

If the available projects do not suit you, or you make it clear that you are not interested in the opportunities we offer, we may consider that it is not the best time for you to be part of Shakers.

3. You do not follow the community rules

At Shakers, we are guided by clear values: commitment, communication, and transparency. If a profile does not follow these rules, especially in application processes or collaborations, we may remove it from the platform.

ðŸš¨ Serious offenses that do lead to immediate expulsion

There are situations that we consider particularly sensitive and that may result in immediate expulsion:

Failing to comply with the terms agreed with the client, without notifying us or seeking a solution.

Repeatedly interrupting contact with the client or the Shakers team. If we believe you are ghosting, we will consider the relationship closed.

Behavior that negatively affects the project or the team, whether due to attitude, communication, or serious breaches.

Our goal is not to "expel" anyone, but to maintain a healthy and high-quality collaborative environment.
So, if at any time you are going through a difficult situation, let us know. We are here to help you and find solutions with you.
