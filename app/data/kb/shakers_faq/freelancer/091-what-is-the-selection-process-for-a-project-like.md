**Answer:**

🔍 1. Review your profile

Before applying, make sure your profile is a good match for the project. This includes specialties, skills, and languages.

📤 2. Apply for the project

From the project page, click on "Apply." Take this opportunity to:

Briefly introduce yourself

Show interest and enthusiasm

Suggest several slots to meet with the client using Shakers video calls

🤝 3. Connect with the client

Use the chat💬 or video call to get to know the client and fully understand the project. This meeting is key to:

See if there is a real match between you

Clarify any doubts

Gather all the necessary information to prepare a good financial proposal

💼 4. Send your financial proposal

Now it's time to talk numbers. Use the proposal generator within the platform. Do not use PDFs, as the system does not support them.

You can choose between three options:

Monthly fee

Milestones

Hourly rate

Choose the one that best suits your way of working.


✍️ 5. Sign the agreement

When the client accepts your proposal, a legal agreement is automatically generated, which includes:

All the terms you agreed upon

📩 You will receive a confirmation email when the client accepts. From there, it's time to get to work!
