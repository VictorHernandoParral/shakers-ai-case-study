# What to do if you have already delivered the milestone and the client has not paid?

**Q:** What to do if you have already delivered the milestone and the client has not paid?

**A:** Contact the project's Account Manager immediately

Go to the project chat

In the upper right corner, you will see three dots with photos of the client, the Account Manager, and yourself

Click on the Account Manager's photo to open a private 1-to-1 chat

ðŸ’¬ Tell them what has happened so they can deal with it directly with the client. It may be that they have simply forgotten to make the payment.

2. You can also write to them by email

If you have their email address, you can communicate the situation directly that way.

ðŸ§  Shakers tip

To avoid this type of situation, never start working on a milestone that is in "pending payment" status.
If you don't know how to check the status, check it from your dashboard or contact your Account Manager before you start.
