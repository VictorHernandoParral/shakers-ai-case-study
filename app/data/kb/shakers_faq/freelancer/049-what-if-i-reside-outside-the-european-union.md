**Answer:**

If your bank account is outside the EU, keep in mind two important aspects:

1. International transfer fee

ðŸš¨ The bank commission is at your expense.
It is usually low (around 3% of the invoice value), but varies depending on your bank and country.

2. Exchange rate

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Currency conversion is applied according to the exchange rate of the bank involved in the transaction.
Shakers does not charge any fees for conversion, but it does not control the exchange rate either.
