**Answer:**

Certifying your skills is key to advancing your process within Shakers.
It helps us validate your profile and increases your chances of being selected for projects that suit you.

Here's how to do it, step by step 👇

🔍 Access from your profile

Log in to your profile and go to the "Skills" tab.

Next to each skill, you will see a button to start the certification process.


📌 Options for certifying your skills

Once you enter the process, a modal will open where you can choose between several ways to certify your skill:

✅ Uploading a document

It must be official, valid, and in PDF format.

Examples: diploma, contract, company certificate, etc.

Make sure it clearly reflects your experience in that skill.

✅ Requesting an external review of a project

From a project you have uploaded to your portfolio

You can request a review from a previous client directly from the platform.

✅ Requesting a professional reference

From the "Experience" section, you can request references from a former boss or colleague.

They will receive a simple form to validate your skills.

✅ Through projects on Shakers

When you complete a project on the platform and the client validates it, the skills you used in that project will be automatically certified.

✅ Taking a technical test

You can choose to take an online technical test.
