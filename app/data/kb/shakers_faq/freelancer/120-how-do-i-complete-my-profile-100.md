**Answer:**

1. Profile photo

Your first impression.
You don't need a studio photo, but you do need:

Good lighting

A neutral background

A clear, professional look


2. At least 7 skills

Tell us what you do best. Examples:

UX/UI

Project management

Backend with Node.js

Motion graphics

Copywriting in English

ðŸŽ¯ Tip: choose skills that you truly master and want to continue offering.

3. Availability

Can you work full-time or just a few hours a week?
Be clear about this. That way, you'll only receive projects that suit you.

4. Your rate

Set a range that reflects your experience.
Not sure where to start? Look at average rates on similar platforms, or talk to other freelancers.

ðŸ’¸ Remember: you can set an hourly rate or a project rate.

5. Portfolio (minimum 3 projects)

Your best showcase.
Showcase projects that speak for you: what you did, what tools you used, what you achieved. And if you can, add links or images.



6. Professional experience

Tell your story: previous roles, companies, dates, and achievements.
You don't need to include everything, just focus on the most relevant information.

7. Tests: Personality + Motivation

These tests help us understand:

How you work

What motivates you

What kind of projects might suit you

Something direct, personal, and catchy.
Example:
"Designer who combines aesthetics and strategy to solve real problems."

9. "About you" + "What you excel at and why"

Here you can take your time to explain who you are: your passions, your work style, why someone should choose you.

ðŸ§© This is your space to be authentic and set yourself apart.


Once your profile is 100% complete and validated, you'll move on to the screening phase â†’ interview â†’ first project!

ðŸ’™ The more complete your profile is, the more visible you will be for the projects that interest you.
