# What are the steps to register as self-employed?

**Q:** What are the steps to register as self-employed?

**A:** Registration with the Tax Office:

Form 036 or 037: You must submit one of these forms to the Tax Office to notify them of the start of your economic activity. Form 037 is a simplified version of form 036.

Census declaration: This is the document that informs the Tax Office about your activity.

Register with Social Security:

Special Scheme for Self-Employed Workers (RETA): You must register for this scheme. You can do so in two ways:

Online: You will need an electronic certificate or electronic ID card.

In person: At your nearest Social Security office.

Required documentation:

Form 036 or 037 already submitted to the Tax Office.

ID card or foreign resident ID card.

Social Security number.

If you are a foreigner:

Residence and work permit: You will need a residence and self-employment work permit. If you are an EU citizen, you only need your NIE and European Union registration certificate.
