**Answer:**

In order for your application to be successful and aligned with our value proposition, it is essential that you follow the Happy Path. Here we explain how to apply correctly for a project and what to avoid.

1. Check your match level

Before applying, make sure you have at least a 70% match with the project.
If you don't, review and update your profile so you can apply.

2. Write an introductory message to the client

Introduce yourself briefly and show genuine interest in the project.
Include:

Who you are and what motivates you about the project

Propose 2-3 times to schedule a video call directly through Shakers


3. Highlight your relevant experience

Select 2 projects from your portfolio that are related to what the client needs.
This will give them confidence and clarity about your experience.

4. Click "Apply and send"

The client will receive your application and can start the conversation.
