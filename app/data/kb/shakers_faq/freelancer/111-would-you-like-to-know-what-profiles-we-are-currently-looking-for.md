# Would you like to know what profiles we are currently looking for?

**Q:** Would you like to know what profiles we are currently looking for?

**A:** 3. Years of Experience

Most projects are for experienced profiles. That's why we tend to prioritize people with at least 2 years of experience in their specialty.

üõ†Ô∏è If you are just starting out, don't worry. You can strengthen your profile with good descriptions, projects, and certifications.

4. Professional Career

We look beyond time: we want to understand your evolution. Have you taken on more responsibilities? Have you led teams or key projects? Tell us about it!

Example of what adds points:

"I went from being a junior designer to leading a design team in two years."

"I was responsible for launching the payment app for X company with 100K+ users."

5. Certifications and Licenses

Having certifications is a nice bonus. They help us validate your technical knowledge objectively.
