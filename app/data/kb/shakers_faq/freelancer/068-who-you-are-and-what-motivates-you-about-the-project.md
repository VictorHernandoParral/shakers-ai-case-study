# Who you are and what motivates you about the project

**Q:** Who you are and what motivates you about the project

**A:** Propose 2-3 times to schedule a video call directly through Shakers

ðŸ’¡ We use artificial intelligence to help you write this first message based on your profile and the project. You can edit it if you wish.

3. Highlight your relevant experience

Select 2 projects from your portfolio that are related to what the client needs.
This will give them confidence and clarity about your experience.

4. Click "Apply and send"

The client will receive your application and can start the conversation.

ðŸš¨ Very important: What you should not do

During the conversation with the client in the Shakers chat, DO NOT share:

Your personal email address

Your phone number

Your Calendly or other external scheduling tools

Your hourly rate or financial proposals in PDF format

ðŸ’¬ All communication must be kept within the platform so that the Account Manager, who is also in that chat, can help you if necessary.
