**Answer:**

Base variables

These are required in order to calculate a match percentage. They are used to calculate a base match percentage and ensure that the minimum technical requirements for applying to a project are always met.

Freelancer's knowledge: naturally, we take into account a freelancer's technical knowledge (specialties, super specialties, skills, and tools they know how to use).

Freelancer's experience: we use information about the skills developed in past projects. 

Project requirements: the set of knowledge and skills that a client demands for their project.

This way, a user who has the skills "WordPress" or "Web Design" validated in their profile will have a high "base" match percentage with projects that require those skills. 

Similarly, a user who has no knowledge of a technology such as "React" will never be able to have a high enough match percentage to apply for a "React" project.

Accuracy variables

The second set of variables allows us to adjust the match percentage based on criteria beyond strictly professional ones, rewarding users who have a higher level of motivation and cultural fit with a project.

At Shakers, we have a mantra: a motivated worker will always deliver better results than one who is only looking for a paycheck at the end of the month. That's why we should always try to find candidates who stand out not only for their skills, but also for their desire to participate in a project.

Personality: based on the Big Five personality model, we have designed two personality tests for the workplace that allow us to predict the level of personal affinity between a freelancer, a client, and the entire team that will be participating in a project. Because, don't we all like to have a good vibe at work? Right?

Motivation: after conducting a study of more than 80 freelancers and company managers, we found that the variables that most influence motivation are: the type of professional challenge, the company's values, and the industry or sector of that company. Therefore, we have designed a test to identify a freelancer's interests and give a higher match percentage to projects that fit the talent's motivations.

If you want the match percentage you see in the application to be as accurate as possible, you will need to  so that all these accuracy variables can be taken into account.
