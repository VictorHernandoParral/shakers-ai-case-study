# Why do we limit access to Shakers?

**Q:** Why do we limit access to Shakers?

**A:** At Shakers, we limit access to ensure quality, balance, and real opportunities for freelancers. We prioritize those who are already active members of the community. We are committed to long-term relationships, not one-off collaborations.

At Shakers, we don't want to be just another platform. We want to be your home as a freelancer, a place where you can find real, well-paid opportunities that allow you to grow.

That's why we limit access to the platform. It's not to exclude anyone, but to take care of the experience of each person who joins. Our goal is to achieve a real balance between the amount of talent and the availability of projects.

Even so, with limited access, you can view some projects and apply for them. We want you to start exploring how Shakers works and give you the opportunity to showcase your talent from the very beginning.

üéØ Quality > Quantity

We prefer to offer fewer projects, but of higher quality. It's part of our philosophy: we don't seek to have thousands of irrelevant projects or sign up talent en masse. We are committed to the best, which is why we filter both the projects that come in and the freelance profiles that access the platform. We want the best.

Yes, that means there may be fewer projects available at certain times. But it also means that the projects that are available are good ones, designed to really add value to your career.

‚öñÔ∏è Balance

We're committed to maintaining balance within the platform. We want to ensure that there are enough projects for all active freelancers. If there are no opportunities that suit you at a given moment, we prefer that you wait. That way, when you log in, you'll have a better chance of finding a project that really interests you.

üöÄ Your first project: the key to Share of Wallet

Your first project is much more than a one-off collaboration. It is the gateway to the Shakers ecosystem. From that moment on, we become part of your client portfolio, and our goal is to remain relevant in your professional career. We call this Share of Wallet.

We want you to come back, grow with us, and find a stable space to work as a freelancer at Shakers. No one-off projects or sporadic relationships. We are committed to long-term relationships.

So much so that our North Star Metric, the metric that guides everything we do, is the number of people who work more than 100 hours a month with us. That's the sign that we're on the right track.

Now do you understand why we limit access and prioritize the talent that is already inside? We close the community because we will always put those who are already working or about to close their next project first. We want you to find continuity, not just opportunities.
