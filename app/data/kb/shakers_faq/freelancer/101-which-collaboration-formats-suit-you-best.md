# Which collaboration formats suit you best.

**Q:** Which collaboration formats suit you best.

**A:** ðŸŽ¯ Remember: everything influences the matching algorithm.

Ready to optimize your profile? Taking a few minutes to do so can make the difference between being left out or landing the project you're excited about!

ðŸŒŸ Experience

We have rolled out a new feature that allows you to export your experience from LinkedIn. Having all your LinkedIn experience on Shakers will allow clients to see what you have done in your last few years of work (whether as a freelancer or as an employee).

ðŸŒŸ  Portfolio

We suggest you add at least three projects: highlight the projects you feel most proud of when you look back and explain why (remember that this is also part of your cover letter).

(FACT: 90% of Shakers who have completed this section generate greater confidence in the eyes of clients and therefore obtain a higher project closure ratio).

ðŸŒŸ Skills

This tool is one of the most important parts of your professional profile on Shakers, so it is important to keep it up to date and add new skills as you improve as a professional.

ðŸŒŸ Personal

Make sure that both your portfolio and the link to your LinkedIn profile are always up to date, as well as your availability and languages.

In this section, you have the opportunity to present yourself in a more personal way, especially in the sections "Describe yourself in one sentence," "About you," and "What you excel at and why."

ðŸŒŸ Motivation

Take the motivation test so we can find out which industries motivate you the most, as well as the type of projects and companies. Remember that everything influences the match algorithm!
