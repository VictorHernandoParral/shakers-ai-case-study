# Am I entitled to paternity leave? Can I forego the leave? Who pays for paternity leave?

**Q:** Am I entitled to paternity leave? Can I forego the leave? Who pays for paternity leave?

**A:** All self-employed workers who have become fathers must take compulsory, uninterrupted paternity leave for the first six weeks after the birth.

However, after the six weeks that are mandatory under current regulations, they may choose not to take the remaining 10 weeks.

Self-employed workers must apply for the benefit by submitting the following documentation to Social Security:

ID card

Hospital medical report of the birth

Family record book or certificate of registration of the child in the Civil Registry

Proof of registration with both Social Security and the Tax Authorities.

The Social Security contributions of self-employed workers who do not pay contributions while they are on sick leave are paid by the INSS.
