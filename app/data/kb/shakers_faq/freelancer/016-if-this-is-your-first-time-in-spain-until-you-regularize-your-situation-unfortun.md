# If this is your first time in Spain, until you regularize your situation, unfortunately, you will not be able to register as a self-employed worker. What expenses related to my activity can I deduct?

**Q:** If this is your first time in Spain, until you regularize your situation, unfortunately, you will not be able to register as a self-employed worker. What expenses related to my activity can I deduct?

**A:** Here are some examples of VAT-deductible expenses:

Supplies

Water, electricity, gas, telephone, and internet. For self-employed workers who work from home, a percentage of these expenses can be deducted, calculated based on the space dedicated to professional activity.

Note: Since 2018, you can deduct 30% of utility expenses calculated based on the percentage of the home's floor space dedicated to the activity.

Office supplies

Stationery, printer cartridges, computer equipment, etc.

Rent

Rental of premises, offices, or coworking spaces. If you work from home, you can deduct the percentage of rent corresponding to the space dedicated to your business activity.

Vehicles

Fuel, maintenance, and vehicle insurance. Vehicle deductions are only allowed if the vehicle is used for professional activities and is adequately justified.

Insurance

Civil liability insurance, health insurance for the self-employed person, their spouse, and children under 25 living at home. The maximum deductible premium is €500 per person (€1,500 in the case of persons with disabilities).

Training and Travel

Courses, seminars, and travel related to professional activity. These include transportation, accommodation, and per diem expenses, provided they are duly justified and related to the activity.

Advertising and Promotion

Expenses for advertising, marketing, website, etc.

Financial Expenses
