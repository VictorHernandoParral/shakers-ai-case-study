**Answer:**

1. Click on the pencil icon to the right of each skill

This allows you to update the necessary fields to get closer to 70%.

2. Adjust your super specialty

ðŸ“Œ If, for example, the client is looking for a No Code Web Developer as a super specialty, but you have another one, change it in the editor and save the changes.

3. Add the essential skills

Example: the project requires these 2 skills:

No code

Prototyping

And you only have one of the two. Solution:

Go to "Edit"

Add the ones you're missing

Assign stars according to your level of experience

4. Complete the required languages

If you are missing a language that the client has marked as mandatory, simply:

Click on the pencil next to languages

Add the missing language

Select your actual level
